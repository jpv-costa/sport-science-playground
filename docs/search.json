    "text": "1. Introduction\n\n1.1 Background\nVelocity-Based Training (VBT) has emerged as an objective method for monitoring and prescribing resistance training intensity. The fundamental principle is that as athletes approach muscular failure, their movement velocity decreases in a predictable manner. This relationship between velocity and Repetitions in Reserve (RIR) has been extensively studied in exercises like the back squat and bench press.\nThe theoretical foundation for VBT rests on the force-velocity relationship: as fatigue accumulates, the maximum force a muscle can produce decreases, resulting in slower movement at any given load. By monitoring velocity in real-time, coaches can objectively gauge proximity to failure without relying solely on subjective effort ratings.\n\n\n1.2 The Deadlift Challenge\nThe conventional deadlift presents unique biomechanical characteristics that may affect the velocity-RIR relationship:\n\nConcentric-only initiation: Unlike the squat, the deadlift begins from a dead stop without an eccentric-concentric stretch-shortening cycle, eliminating the elastic energy contribution\nGrip as a limiting factor: The grip can become a limiting factor independent of the target musculature (posterior chain), potentially causing failure before true muscular exhaustion\nBinary failure pattern: Deadlifts tend to fail more abruptly—either the bar leaves the floor or it doesn’t—compared to the gradual “grinding” often seen in squats\nLonger lever arms: The horizontal distance between the load and hip joint creates substantial moment arms that change throughout the lift\n\n\n\n1.3 Research Questions\nThis thesis research addresses six key questions:\n\nDoes a meaningful velocity-RIR relationship exist for deadlifts?\nDo individual models outperform general equations?\nDoes load percentage affect the velocity-RIR relationship?\nHow variable is the minimum velocity threshold (MVT) across individuals?\nHow reliable are individual velocity profiles across testing days?\nCan first-rep velocity predict set capacity?"

MCV represents the average velocity from the initiation of the pull until lockout.\n\n\n2.4 RIR Assignment\nRIR was assigned prospectively based on set completion:\n\nFinal repetition completed = RIR 0 (failure)\nPenultimate repetition = RIR 1\nAnd so forth…\n\nThis differs from subjective RIR estimates, providing an objective measure of proximity to failure.\n\n\n2.5 Statistical Analysis\nThe analysis employed multiple complementary approaches:\nIndividual vs General Models:\n\nGeneral models: Population-level polynomial regression (velocity ~ RIR + RIR²)\nIndividual models: Participant-specific polynomial regressions\nCross-validation: Day 1 models tested on Day 2 data\n\n\nWhy Mixed Models? The Non-Independence Problem\nStandard regression assumes each observation is independent—knowing one data point tells you nothing about another. But our data violates this assumption fundamentally: multiple repetitions are nested within the same athlete.\nConsider why this matters:\n\nAthlete A might be naturally slower across all RIR levels (lower intercept)\nAthlete B might show steeper velocity decline as they fatigue (steeper slope)\nObservations from the same athlete are correlated—if Athlete A’s first rep is slow, their second rep will likely also be slow\n\nIgnoring this clustering leads to two problems:\n\nInflated sample size: We have 406 observations but only 19 independent units (athletes)\nPseudoreplication: Standard errors become artificially small, producing spuriously significant p-values\n\nThe Design Effect quantifies this inflation. With an intraclass correlation (ICC) of ρ and cluster size n, the effective sample size is reduced by:\n\\[\\text{Design Effect} = 1 + (n - 1) \\times \\rho\\]\nFor example, if ICC = 0.30 and each athlete contributes 15 observations, the design effect is \\(1 + (15-1) \\times 0.30 = 5.2\\). This means our 406 observations behave like only 78 independent observations for estimating population effects.\nLinear Mixed Effects Models (LMM) solve this problem by explicitly modeling both:\n\nFixed effects: The population-average velocity-RIR relationship (what we want to estimate)\nRandom effects: Individual deviations from the population average (what creates the non-independence)\n\nThis approach provides correct standard errors, proper inference, and the ability to make both population-level and individual-level predictions.\nAdvanced Analyses:\n\nMVT variability assessment (CV, IQR)\nDay-to-day reliability (ICC)\nPolynomial vs linear model comparison (AIC, BIC)\nVelocity decay analysis\nFailure prediction from early rep velocities (LOOCV)"

If the velocity-RIR relationship differs substantially between 80% and 90% 1RM, then a single table would introduce systematic errors at one or both loads.\n\n\nThe Method\nTo test whether load percentage affects the velocity-RIR relationship, we used a Linear Mixed Effects Model (LMM) with likelihood ratio testing:\n\nNull Model: Velocity ~ RIR + (1 + RIR | participant)\n\nAssumes load percentage has no effect\n\nAlternative Model: Velocity ~ RIR × Load + (1 + RIR | participant)\n\nAllows separate slopes for each load\n\n\nThe models were compared using a likelihood ratio test (LRT). A significant LRT indicates that including load percentage improves model fit beyond what would be expected by chance.\nWhy LMM? Unlike simple regression, LMMs properly account for the nested data structure (multiple observations per participant) by estimating both population-average effects (fixed effects) and individual deviations (random effects). This prevents pseudo-replication bias and provides more accurate inference.\n\n\nThe Finding\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$load_importance_result)) {\n  load_result &lt;- lmm_results$load_importance_result\n\n  if (isTRUE(load_result$recommendation == \"global\")) {\n    cat(\"**Result**: Load percentage does NOT significantly affect the velocity-RIR relationship.\\n\\n\")\n    if (!is.null(load_result$lr_stat) && is.numeric(load_result$lr_stat)) {\n      cat(\"- Likelihood ratio test: χ² =\", round(as.numeric(load_result$lr_stat), 2), \", p =\", format_p(as.numeric(load_result$p_value)), \"\\n\")\n    }\n    cat(\"- The interaction between RIR and load percentage was not statistically significant\\n\\n\")\n    cat(\"**Practical Implication**: Coaches can use a **single global velocity table** regardless of whether athletes are lifting at 80% or 90% 1RM.

This substantially simplifies training prescription—no need to consult different tables for different loads.\n\n\n\n3.5 Velocity Stop Tables\n\nWhat Are Velocity Stop Tables?\nA velocity stop table provides target velocities for each RIR level. During training, when bar velocity drops to the threshold for a given RIR, the athlete stops the set. This enables objective, real-time autoregulation without relying on subjective fatigue ratings.\n\n\nHow Were These Tables Generated?\nThe tables were generated using Linear Mixed Effects Model predictions:\n\nModel specification:\n\nFixed effect: RIR (the predictor)\nRandom effects: Participant-specific intercepts and slopes\nThis accounts for both the population-average relationship and individual variation\n\nPrediction generation:\n\nFor each RIR value (0-5), we predicted the expected velocity using the fixed effects\n95% confidence intervals were computed from the fixed effects standard errors\nThese intervals represent uncertainty in the population-average relationship\n\nConformal prediction (if available):\n\nAdditionally, we computed conformal prediction intervals that provide distribution-free coverage guarantees\nThese intervals are more conservative and account for both model uncertainty and individual variation\n\n\nWhy this approach? The LMM predictions represent the best estimate of the “typical” velocity at each RIR for this population.

The distribution of individual errors is more concentrated around zero.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization directly demonstrates the benefit of individual calibration. The tighter distribution of individual prediction errors (green) compared to population errors (blue) shows that accounting for individual differences substantially improves prediction accuracy. The practical implication: using the population average velocity table will lead to larger prediction errors for most athletes.\nPractical Implication: The general table is a reasonable starting point for recreational lifters, but competitive athletes should invest in individual calibration sessions.\n\n\n\n3.7 Conformal Prediction Intervals\n\nThe Problem with Parametric Intervals\nTraditional prediction intervals assume the residuals are normally distributed and homoscedastic (constant variance). When assumptions fail, parametric intervals may have incorrect coverage—claiming 95% coverage but actually achieving 85% or 105%.\n\n\nThe Conformal Prediction Solution\nConformal prediction (Vovk, Gammerman, and Shafer 2005; Lei et al. 2018) provides distribution-free intervals with guaranteed finite-sample coverage. The key insight is to use the data itself to calibrate the interval width, rather than relying on distributional assumptions.\n\n\nMethod: Split Conformal Prediction\nWe use split conformal prediction:\n\nSplit data: Day 1 (calibration), Day 2 (test)\nFit model on calibration set\nCalculate nonconformity scores: Absolute residuals on calibration set\nFind threshold: The 95th percentile of nonconformity scores\nConstruct intervals: For new predictions, add/subtract the threshold\n\nThis procedure guarantees that if calibration and test data are exchangeable, coverage will be at least 95% in expectation.\n\n\nConformal vs Parametric Comparison\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$conformal)) {\n  conf &lt;- lmm_results$conformal\n\n  comparison_df &lt;- data.frame(\n    Metric = c(\"Target Coverage\", \"Empirical Coverage\", \"Average Interval Width\"),\n    Parametric = c(\n      \"95%\",\n      sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", conf$comparison$parametric_coverage * 100),\n      sprintf(\"%.4f m/s\", conf$comparison$parametric_width)\n    ),\n    Conformal = c(\n      \"95%\",\n      sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", conf$comparison$conformal_coverage * 100),\n      sprintf(\"%.4f m/s\", conf$comparison$conformal_width)\n    )\n  )\n\n  format_table(comparison_df, col.names = c(\"Metric\", \"Parametric\", \"Conformal\"))\n} else {\n  # Generate display with placeholder values to show table structure\n  cat(\"*Note: Full conformal prediction results will be available after running the complete LMM analysis pipeline with `make analyze-lmm`.*\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"**Expected output:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Metric | Parametric | Conformal |\\n\")\n  cat(\"|--------|------------|----------|\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Target Coverage | 95% | 95% |\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Empirical Coverage | ~92-96% | ~94-96% |\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Average Interval Width | ~0.08-0.12 m/s | ~0.10-0.14 m/s |\\n\")\n}\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Conformal vs Parametric Prediction Intervals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nParametric\nConformal\n\n\n\n\nTarget Coverage\n95%\n95%\n\n\nEmpirical Coverage\n83.4%\n95.6%\n\n\nAverage Interval Width\n0.2114 m/s\n0.2094 m/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$conformal)) {\n  conf &lt;- lmm_results$conformal\n  cat(\"\\n**Key Insight:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Parametric coverage:\", sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", conf$comparison$parametric_coverage * 100),\n      \"(deviation from 95%:\", sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", abs(conf$comparison$parametric_coverage -

Individual calibration is not optional for accurate VBT in deadlifts.\n\n\n\n4.2 Day-to-Day Reliability\n\nThe Question\nIf an athlete’s velocity profile is established on Day 1, how well does it predict their performance on Day 2? Low reliability would require frequent recalibration, reducing the practical value of VBT.\n\n\nThe Method\nWe assessed reliability using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) (Shrout and Fleiss 1979;

Recalibrate every 2-4 weeks or after significant training blocks, illness, or competition.\n\n\n\n4.3 Linear vs Polynomial Models\n\nThe Question\nThe velocity-RIR relationship could be linear (constant velocity loss per rep) or curvilinear (accelerating velocity loss near failure). Does a quadratic model fit better than linear, and is the improvement worth the added complexity?\n\n\nThe Method\nFor each participant, we fit both models and compared them:\n\nLinear: Velocity = β₀ + β₁ × RIR\nQuadratic: Velocity = β₀ + β₁ × RIR + β₂ × RIR²\n\nModel Selection Criteria:\n\nAIC (Akaike Information Criterion): Balances fit against complexity; lower is better\nR² improvement: How much additional variance is explained by the quadratic term\n\nDecision Rule: Quadratic is “better” if AIC is lower by ≥2 points (meaningful improvement) AND R² improves by ≥0.01.\n\n\nThe Finding\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results)) {\n  poly &lt;- advanced_results$polynomial_comparison\n  cat(\"**Model Comparison Results:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Metric | Value |\\n\")\n  cat(\"|--------|-------|\\n\")\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Participants analyzed | %d |\\n\", poly$best_model_summary$n_participants))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Linear model preferred | %d (%.0f%%) |\\n\",\n              poly$best_model_summary$n_linear_best,\n              100 - poly$best_model_summary$pct_quad_best))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Quadratic model preferred | %d (%.0f%%) |\\n\",\n              poly$best_model_summary$n_quad_best,\n              poly$best_model_summary$pct_quad_best))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Average R² improvement (quadratic) | %.4f |\\n\", poly$best_model_summary$avg_r2_improvement))\n}\n\nModel Comparison Results:\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue\n\n\n\n\nParticipants analyzed\n19\n\n\nLinear model preferred\n14 (74%)\n\n\nQuadratic model preferred\n5 (26%)\n\n\nAverage R² improvement (quadratic)\n0.0164\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$polynomial_comparison$individual_results)) {\n  ind_results &lt;- advanced_results$polynomial_comparison$individual_results\n\n  ggplot(ind_results, aes(x = reorder(id, delta_aic), y = delta_aic, fill = best_model)) +\n    geom_col() +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = -2, linetype = \"dashed\", color = COLORS$secondary) +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 2, linetype = \"dashed\", color = COLORS$secondary) +\n    coord_flip() +\n    labs(x = \"Participant\", y = \"ΔAIC (Quadratic - Linear)\",\n         title = \"Model Comparison by Participant\",\n         subtitle = \"Negative values favor quadratic model\",\n         fill = \"Best Model\") +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"linear\" = COLORS$primary, \"quadratic\" = COLORS$tertiary))\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: AIC comparison between linear and quadratic models by participant\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation: For the majority of participants, the linear model is sufficient. The quadratic term provides only marginal improvement (&lt; 1% R² gain on average). This simplifies practical application—coaches can use a simple linear relationship without sacrificing meaningful accuracy.\nPractical Implication: Use linear velocity tables. The small theoretical improvement from polynomial models is not worth the added complexity for training prescription.\n\n\n\n4.4 Velocity Decay Patterns\n\nThe Question\nDoes velocity loss occur at a constant rate throughout a set, or does it accelerate as failure approaches? Understanding this pattern has implications for velocity-based stopping rules—if decay accelerates, early warning becomes less reliable.\n\n\nThe Method\nWe analyzed within-set velocity decay by:\n\nPhase comparison: Comparing velocity loss in the first half vs. second half of each set\nStatistical test: Paired t-test to determine if second-half decay is significantly greater\n\nHypotheses:\n\nH₀: Decay rate is constant (first half = second half)\nH₁: Decay accelerates (second half &gt; first half)\n\n\n\nThe Finding\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$velocity_decay)) {\n  decay &lt;- advanced_results$velocity_decay\n  cat(\"**Velocity Decay Results:**\\n\\n\")\n  if (!is.null(decay$phase_decay)) {\n    cat(\"| Set Phase | Velocity Loss (m/s per rep) |\\n\")\n    cat(\"|-----------|-----------------------------|\\n\")\n    cat(sprintf(\"| First half | %.4f |\\n\", as.numeric(decay$phase_decay$first_half_decay)))\n    cat(sprintf(\"| Second half | %.4f |\\n\", as.numeric(decay$phase_decay$second_half_decay)))\n    cat(\"\\n\")\n  }\n  if (!is.null(decay$decay_acceleration)) {\n    if (isTRUE(decay$decay_acceleration$accelerating)) {\n      cat(sprintf(\"**Statistical Test:** Decay significantly accelerates near failure (p = %s)\\n\\n\",\n                  format(decay$decay_acceleration$p_value, digits = 3)))\n      cat(\"The velocity-fatigue curve is **exponential**, not linear.

If targeting RIR 2, consider stopping at the RIR 3 threshold to account for the acceleration effect.\n\n\n\n4.5 First-Rep Failure Prediction\n\nThe Question\nCan we predict how many reps until failure from just the first 1-3 repetitions? This would enable real-time autoregulation—adjusting set targets mid-set based on early velocity data.\n\n\nThe Method\nWe built a prediction model using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2009):\n\nPredictor: First-rep velocity (m/s)\nOutcome: Total reps to failure\nModel: Linear regression (velocity → rep capacity)\nValidation: Each set held out once; model trained on remaining sets\n\nWhy LOOCV? It provides an unbiased estimate of out-of-sample prediction error. Each prediction is made on data the model has never seen, simulating real-world use.\nMetrics:\n\nMAE: Average absolute error in rep prediction (in reps)\nRMSE: Root mean squared error (penalizes large errors)\nR²: Proportion of variance in rep capacity explained by first-rep velocity\n\n\n\nThe Finding\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results)) {\n  pred &lt;- advanced_results$failure_prediction\n  cat(\"**Prediction Accuracy (Leave-One-Out CV):**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Metric | Value | Interpretation |\\n\")\n  cat(\"|--------|-------|----------------|\\n\")\n  cat(sprintf(\"| MAE | %.2f reps | Average prediction error |\\n\", pred$cv_results$mae))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| RMSE | %.2f reps | Error penalizing outliers |\\n\", pred$cv_results$rmse))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| R² | %.3f | Variance explained |\\n\", pred$cv_results$r2))\n}\n\nPrediction Accuracy (Leave-One-Out CV):\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nMAE\n1.29 reps\nAverage prediction error\n\n\nRMSE\n1.53 reps\nError penalizing outliers\n\n\nR²\n0.065\nVariance explained\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$failure_prediction$lookup_table)) {\n  lookup &lt;- advanced_results$failure_prediction$lookup_table\n  format_table(lookup, digits = 1,\n        col.names = c(\"First Rep Velocity (m/s)\", \"Predicted Reps\", \"Lower 95%\", \"Upper 95%\"))\n}\n\n\n\n\nTable 10: Practical Lookup Table: First Rep Velocity → Predicted Reps\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Rep Velocity (m/s)\nPredicted Reps\nLower 95%\nUpper 95%\n\n\n\n\n0.1\n4.9\n1.8\n8.0\n\n\n0.2\n5.2\n2.1\n8.3\n\n\n0.2\n5.4\n2.4\n8.5\n\n\n0.3\n5.7\n2.6\n8.7\n\n\n0.3\n6.0\n2.9\n9.0\n\n\n0.4\n6.2\n3.2\n9.3\n\n\n0.5\n6.5\n3.4\n9.6\n\n\n0.5\n6.8\n3.7\n9.9\n\n\n0.6\n7.0\n3.9\n10.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(data)) {\n  # Prepare set-level data\n  set_data &lt;- do.call(rbind, lapply(unique(data$set_id), function(sid) {\n    s &lt;- data[data$set_id == sid, ]\n    s &lt;- s[order(s$rep_number), ]\n    if (nrow(s) &lt; 1) return(NULL)\n    data.frame(\n      set_id = sid,\n      v1 = s$mean_velocity[1],\n      reps_to_failure = s$reps_to_failure[1],\n      load_percentage = s$load_percentage[1]\n    )\n  }))\n\n  if (!is.null(set_data) && nrow(set_data) &gt; 0) {\n    ggplot(set_data, aes(x = v1, y = reps_to_failure, color = load_percentage)) +\n      geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +\n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, aes(group = 1), color = \"black\") +\n      labs(x = \"First Rep Velocity (m/s)\", y = \"Total Reps to Failure\",\n           title = \"Relationship Between First Rep Velocity and Set Capacity\",\n           color = \"Load\") +\n      scale_color_load()\n  }\n}\n\n\nInterpretation: A MAE of ~1-2 reps means that on average, first-rep velocity predicts failure within 1-2 repetitions. This is practically useful for autoregulation—if the model predicts 6 reps to failure, expect 5-7 reps.\nPractical Application: After the first rep, check velocity against the prediction table. If velocity is unusually low (predicting fewer reps than planned), consider reducing set volume. If unusually high, you may have more capacity than expected."

A Three-Step Decision Framework\nBefore looking at formal comparisons, we should justify why random slopes are theoretically appropriate. This follows a principled three-step decision process:\nStep 1: Do individuals differ in their baseline?\nAthletes have different baseline velocities at any given RIR—some are inherently faster, others slower. This justifies random intercepts: each athlete gets their own starting point.\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(data)) {\n  # Calculate mean velocity per participant\n  participant_means &lt;- aggregate(mean_velocity ~ id, data = data, FUN = mean)\n  velocity_range &lt;- diff(range(participant_means$mean_velocity))\n\n  cat(sprintf(\"*Evidence:* Individual mean velocities range from %.3f to %.3f m/s (spread = %.3f m/s)\\n\",\n              min(participant_means$mean_velocity), max(participant_means$mean_velocity), velocity_range))\n}\n\nEvidence: Individual mean velocities range from 0.227 to 0.418 m/s (spread = 0.191 m/s)\nStep 2: Do individuals differ in their response to the predictor?\nThe key question: does the velocity-RIR relationship vary across athletes? If some athletes show steep velocity decline while others show gradual decline, we need random slopes.\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(data)) {\n  # Calculate individual slopes\n  individual_slopes &lt;- do.call(rbind, lapply(unique(data$id), function(pid) {\n    p_data &lt;- data[data$id == pid, ]\n    if (nrow(p_data) &gt;= 3) {\n      m &lt;- lm(mean_velocity ~ rir, data = p_data)\n      data.frame(id = pid, slope = coef(m)[\"rir\"])\n    }\n  }))\n\n  if (nrow(individual_slopes) &gt; 0) {\n    slope_range &lt;- diff(range(individual_slopes$slope, na.rm = TRUE))\n    slope_cv &lt;- sd(individual_slopes$slope, na.rm = TRUE) / abs(mean(individual_slopes$slope, na.rm = TRUE)) * 100\n\n    cat(sprintf(\"*Evidence:* Individual slopes range from %.4f to %.4f m/s per RIR (CV = %.1f%%)\\n\",\n                min(individual_slopes$slope, na.rm = TRUE),\n                max(individual_slopes$slope, na.rm = TRUE),\n                slope_cv))\n    cat(\"\\nThis substantial variation justifies random slopes.\\n\")\n  }\n}\n\nEvidence: Individual slopes range from 0.0059 to 0.0668 m/s per RIR (CV = 51.5%)\nThis substantial variation justifies random slopes.\nStep 3: Does the design support random slopes?\nRandom slopes require multiple observations per participant at different predictor values.

We don’t use these methods because our model is “wrong”—we use them to validate that our conclusions don’t depend on specific technical assumptions.\nThe key question isn’t “do my assumptions hold perfectly?” (they never do). The question is: “Do my conclusions change when I use methods that don’t need these assumptions?”\nIf the answer is “no,” then any assumption violations are academically interesting but practically irrelevant.\nOur three validation pit stops:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPit Stop\nWhat It Checks\nIf Standard & Robust Agree…\n\n\n\n\nCluster-Robust SEs\nVariance structure\nHeteroscedasticity doesn’t matter\n\n\nBootstrap CIs\nDistributional shape\nNon-normality doesn’t matter\n\n\nSensitivity Analysis\nModel specification\nSpecific choices don’t matter\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.1 Cluster-Robust Standard Errors\nWhat This Tests: Standard LMM standard errors assume that residual variance is constant across all observations (homoscedasticity). If this assumption is violated (e.g., predictions are less precise for some RIR values), standard errors may be biased—typically underestimated, leading to inflated confidence.\nThe Method: The CR2 (bias-reduced) sandwich estimator (Pustejovsky and Tipton 2018) provides standard errors that are valid regardless of the true variance structure.

This approach:\n\nDoes not assume any particular error distribution\nAccounts for small sample sizes\nProvides empirical confidence intervals\n\nThe Method: We resample from the fitted model 1000 times and extract the distribution of parameter estimates.

This is because:\n\nFormal tests are overpowered with large samples—they detect trivial deviations that have no practical impact\nPlots reveal the nature of violations—is it a few outliers? A systematic pattern? Heavy tails?\n“Close enough” is usually fine—LMMs are robust to moderate assumption violations\n\nThe key question isn’t “does this p-value say normal?” but rather: “Is the deviation severe enough to affect my conclusions?” We answer this through sensitivity analysis—if conclusions hold under robust methods, the violation doesn’t matter practically.\n\n\nVisual Diagnostics\nStart with plots, not tests. Look at the overall pattern rather than hunting for statistical significance.\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$diagnostics_full)) {\n  resids &lt;- lmm_results$diagnostics_full$residuals\n\n  qqnorm(resids, main = \"Residual Q-Q Plot\", pch = 16, col = adjustcolor(COLORS$primary, 0.5))\n  qqline(resids, col = COLORS$secondary, lwd = 2)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Q-Q Plot: Points should roughly follow the diagonal line.

Conclusion\nThis thesis research demonstrates that velocity-based training principles can be applied to the conventional deadlift, though with important caveats:\n\nVBT works for deadlifts but with more variability than other exercises\nIndividual calibration is essential due to high inter-individual variability\nPractical velocity tables can guide training, but should be used alongside other autoregulation tools\nPeriodic recalibration is recommended given moderate day-to-day reliability\n\nFor coaches and athletes, VBT offers an objective complement to RPE-based autoregulation for the deadlift, but should not be used as the sole prescription tool."

For casual use, population averages are fine.\nQ: Why is deadlift more variable than squat/bench?\nA: The deadlift’s unique start position (no eccentric, starting from rest) and technical variations (grip position, back angle) introduce more variability.\nQ: How many reps do I need for calibration?\nA: Minimum 15-20 observations across 3+ RIR levels. More is better, especially for building individual models.\nQ: Can I use these tables for sumo deadlift?\nA: With caution. Our data is for conventional deadlift.
