    "text": "H2: Minimum Velocity Threshold (MVT) Variability\n\nResearch Question\nHow variable is the velocity at muscular failure (RIR=0) across individuals?\n\n\nTheoretical Background\nThe Minimum Velocity Threshold (MVT) represents the velocity at which an athlete can no longer complete a repetition—essentially, their “failure velocity.” This concept was introduced by González-Badillo & Sánchez-Medina (2010) for the bench press, where they observed relatively consistent MVT values across individuals (~0.17 m/s).\nIf MVT is consistent across individuals, it could serve as a universal failure indicator—coaches could prescribe a “stop velocity” that works for all athletes. However, if MVT varies substantially, individual calibration becomes essential.\n\n\nWhy This Matters for Deadlifts\nThe deadlift may show different MVT patterns than other exercises because:\n\nNo stretch-shortening cycle: Failure occurs from a dead stop, potentially affecting the velocity profile\nGrip as a limiter: Some athletes may fail due to grip rather than posterior chain exhaustion\nBinary failure pattern: Unlike grinding through a squat, deadlifts either leave the floor or they don’t\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nExtracted all observations at RIR = 0 (failure reps)\nCalculated population-level MVT statistics (mean, SD, CV, IQR)\nCalculated individual MVT for each participant\nTested for sex differences using Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric due to small groups)\nTested for load differences (80% vs 90%) using paired comparison\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nPopulation MVT Statistics:\n\n\n  Mean: 0.206 m/s\n\n\n  SD: 0.063 m/s\n\n\n  CV: 30.8 %\n\n\n  IQR: 0.082 m/s\n\n\n  Range: 0.119 - 0.402 m/s\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n# Extract failure data\nfailure_data &lt;- data[data$rir == 0, ]\n\n# Density plot\nggplot(failure_data, aes(x = mean_velocity)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), bins = 20, fill = \"steelblue\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_density(color = \"darkred\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mvt_result$population_stats$mean,\n             linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\", linewidth = 1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = mvt_result$population_stats$mean + 0.02, y = 5,\n           label = paste(\"Mean =\", round(mvt_result$population_stats$mean, 3), \"m/s\"),\n           hjust = 0) +\n  labs(x = \"Velocity at Failure (m/s)\", y = \"Density\",\n       title = \"MVT Distribution Across All Failure Observations\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of Minimum Velocity Threshold (MVT) at failure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n# Individual MVT plot\nind_mvt &lt;- mvt_result$individual_stats\nind_mvt &lt;- ind_mvt[order(ind_mvt$mean_mvt), ]\nind_mvt$id &lt;- factor(ind_mvt$id, levels = ind_mvt$id)\n\nggplot(ind_mvt, aes(x = id, y = mean_mvt, color = sex)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_mvt - sd_mvt, ymax = mean_mvt + sd_mvt),\n                width = 0.3) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = mvt_result$population_stats$mean,\n             linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray50\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = \"Participant\", y = \"MVT (m/s)\",\n       title = \"Individual MVT with Standard Deviation\",\n       color = \"Sex\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"female\" = \"#E41A1C\", \"male\" = \"#377EB8\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual MVT values showing between-participant variability\n\n\n\n\nLoad Comparison:\n\n\n80% 1RM MVT: 0.217 ± 0.066 m/s\n\n\n90% 1RM MVT: 0.196 ± 0.061 m/s\n\n\nDifference: 0.021 m/s\n\n\np-value: 0.148 \n\n\nSignificant: FALSE \n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe coefficient of variation (CV = 30.8%) indicates high inter-individual variability in MVT.

    "text": "H3: Day-to-Day Reliability\n\nResearch Question\nAre individual velocity-RIR relationships stable across testing days?\n\n\nTheoretical Background\nThe practical utility of VBT depends critically on the reliability of individual velocity profiles. Reliability refers to the consistency of measurements across repeated testing occasions. In the context of VBT:\n\nHigh reliability means an athlete’s velocity-RIR curve is stable—once calibrated, the velocity zones remain valid for an extended period\nLow reliability means the curve shifts substantially between sessions, requiring frequent recalibration\n\nThe Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) is the standard metric for assessing reliability of continuous measures.

    "text": "H4: Polynomial vs Linear Model Comparison\n\nResearch Question\nDoes a quadratic model fit the velocity-RIR relationship better than linear?\n\n\nTheoretical Background\nThe simplest model of the velocity-RIR relationship assumes linear decay—each additional rep costs the same amount of velocity. However, physiological fatigue often follows non-linear patterns:\n\nMetabolic fatigue (e.g., lactate accumulation, ATP depletion) may compound near failure\nNeural fatigue (motor unit dropout, decreased firing rates) may accelerate in later reps\nTechnical breakdown often becomes more pronounced as fatigue accumulates\n\nThese factors suggest the velocity-RIR relationship might be curvilinear, with velocity dropping more rapidly near failure (small RIR values) than earlier in the set.\n\n\nModel Comparison Framework\nWe compare two models:\n\nLinear: velocity = β₀ + β₁(RIR) + ε\nQuadratic: velocity = β₀ + β₁(RIR) + β₂(RIR²) + ε\n\nThe quadratic model adds a curvature term. If β₂ &lt; 0, velocity drops more rapidly near failure (accelerating decay).

This would suggest fatigue accumulates linearly.\nAccelerating decay hypothesis: Later reps cost more velocity than earlier reps. This would suggest fatigue compounds—possibly due to metabolite accumulation, motor unit fatigue, or technique degradation.\n\nThe practical implications are significant:\n\nConstant decay: Simple rep-counting or fixed velocity loss thresholds work well\nAccelerating decay: Athletes should stop sets earlier than velocity loss alone might suggest, as the final reps represent disproportionate fatigue\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters for Training Quality\nIf velocity decay accelerates near failure:\n\nRep quality deteriorates non-linearly: The last 1-2 reps may be substantially lower quality than earlier reps\nTechnical breakdown risk increases: Form often degrades as fatigue compounds\nRecovery cost may be disproportionate: The final grinding reps may cost more in recovery than they contribute to adaptation\n\nUnderstanding decay patterns helps coaches make informed decisions about set termination criteria.\n\n\nMethods\n\nCalculate rep-to-rep velocity change (Δv = v_n - v_{n-1})\nModel decay rate vs rep number: Δv ~ rep_number\nTest if decay accelerates (negative slope = accelerating fatigue)\nCompare early reps (1-3) vs late reps (4+) decay rates\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nVelocity Decay Summary:\n\n\n  Average decay per rep: -0.0283 m/s\n\n\n  Early reps (1-3): -0.0206 m/s\n\n\n  Late reps (4+): -0.0338 m/s\n\n\n  Acceleration: -0.0132 m/s\n\n\nAcceleration Test:\n\n\n  Slope: -0.00318 \n\n\n  p-value: 0.03495 \n\n\n  Interpretation: Decay accelerates toward failure \n\n\n\n\nShow code\n# Create spaghetti plot of velocity trajectories\nggplot(data, aes(x = rep_number, y = mean_velocity, group = set_id)) +\n  geom_line(alpha = 0.3, color = \"steelblue\") +\n  stat_summary(aes(group = 1), fun = mean, geom = \"line\",\n               color = \"darkred\", linewidth = 1.5) +\n  stat_summary(aes(group = 1), fun = mean, geom = \"point\",\n               color = \"darkred\", size = 3) +\n  labs(x = \"Rep Number\", y = \"Mean Velocity (m/s)\",\n       title = \"Velocity Trajectories Across Sets\",\n       subtitle = \"Individual sets (blue) with population mean (red)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nVelocity trajectories for individual sets\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n# Decay by rep number\ndecay_data &lt;- decay$set_trajectories\n\nggplot(decay_data, aes(x = factor(rep_number), y = delta_v)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"steelblue\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray50\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rep Number\", y = \"Velocity Change from Previous Rep (m/s)\",\n       title = \"Rep-to-Rep Velocity Change\",\n       subtitle = \"Negative values indicate velocity loss\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nRep-to-rep velocity change by rep number\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nVelocity decay accelerates as the set progresses (p = 0.035):\n\nEarly reps (1-3): Average decay = 20.6 mm/s per rep\nLate reps (4+): Average decay = 33.8 mm/s per rep\n\nThis 13.2 mm/s acceleration in decay rate suggests:\n\nFatigue compounds near failure - the last few reps cost more velocity than earlier reps\nVelocity thresholds are conservative early - athletes have more “buffer” in early reps\nQuality deteriorates rapidly near failure - this supports stopping 1-2 reps before failure for technique preservation"

The fundamental insight is that first-rep velocity reflects:\n\nRelative intensity: Faster first reps indicate lighter relative loads → more reps available\nDaily readiness: Day-to-day fluctuations in strength affect first-rep velocity\nFatigue state: Accumulated fatigue reduces first-rep velocity\n\nBy combining first-rep velocity with the known velocity-RIR relationship, we can theoretically predict total set capacity before completing the set.\n\n\nWhy This Matters for Practical Training\nThis analysis addresses the most practically valuable question for coaches and athletes:\n\nReal-time autoregulation: Instead of counting reps or guessing RIR, athletes can use first-rep velocity to know approximately how many quality reps are available.\nPre-set planning: Before starting, athletes can perform a “velocity check” with the first rep to decide on set termination strategy.\nDaily autoregulation: On days when first-rep velocity is unexpectedly low, athletes can adjust expectations and avoid overreaching.\n\n\n\nLeave-One-Set-Out Cross-Validation\nWe use leave-one-set-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to estimate prediction accuracy. For each set:\n\nFit the prediction model on all other sets\nPredict the excluded set’s total reps from its first-rep velocity\nCalculate prediction error\n\nThis approach provides an honest estimate of how well the model generalizes to new data.\n\n\nMethods\n\nFor each set, extract: v1 (first rep velocity), v2, v3, and total reps\nBuild prediction models:\n\nModel 1: reps ~ v1\nModel 2: reps ~ v1 + v2\nModel 3: reps ~ v1 + v2 + v3\nModel 4: reps ~ v1 + load\n\nEvaluate with leave-one-set-out cross-validation\nCreate practical lookup table\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nLeave-One-Set-Out Cross-Validation:\n\n\n  Sets analyzed: 66 \n\n\n  MAE: 1.29 reps\n\n\n  RMSE: 1.53 reps\n\n\n  R²: 0.065 \n\n\n  Within ±1 rep: 42.4 %\n\n\n  Within ±2 reps: 75.8 %\n\n\n\n\n\nPractical Lookup Table: First Rep Velocity → Predicted Reps\n\n\nFirst Rep Velocity (m/s)\nPredicted Reps\nLower 95%\nUpper 95%\n\n\n\n\n0.1\n4.9\n1.8\n8.0\n\n\n0.2\n5.2\n2.1\n8.3\n\n\n0.2\n5.4\n2.4\n8.5\n\n\n0.3\n5.7\n2.6\n8.7\n\n\n0.3\n6.0\n2.9\n9.0\n\n\n0.4\n6.2\n3.2\n9.3\n\n\n0.5\n6.5\n3.4\n9.6\n\n\n0.5\n6.8\n3.7\n9.9\n\n\n0.6\n7.0\n3.9\n10.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n# Prepare set-level data\nset_data &lt;- do.call(rbind, lapply(unique(data$set_id), function(sid) {\n  s &lt;- data[data$set_id == sid, ]\n  s &lt;- s[order(s$rep_number), ]\n  if (nrow(s) &lt; 1) return(NULL)\n  data.frame(\n    set_id = sid,\n    v1 = s$mean_velocity[1],\n    reps_to_failure = s$reps_to_failure[1],\n    load_percentage = s$load_percentage[1]\n  )\n}))\n\nggplot(set_data, aes(x = v1, y = reps_to_failure, color = load_percentage)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, aes(group = 1), color = \"black\") +\n  labs(x = \"First Rep Velocity (m/s)\", y = \"Total Reps to Failure\",\n       title = \"Relationship Between First Rep Velocity and Set Capacity\",\n       color = \"Load\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"80%\" = \"#E41A1C\", \"90%\" = \"#377EB8\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst rep velocity vs total reps completed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe first rep velocity provides a reasonable prediction of set capacity:\n\nMAE = 1.29 reps means predictions are typically within ~1 rep of actual\n75.8% accuracy within ±2 reps is sufficient for practical autoregulation\nEach +0.1 m/s in first rep velocity → ~0.5 additional reps expected\n\nPractical Application: Use the lookup table to estimate available reps from your first rep velocity. For example: - First rep at 0.30 m/s → Expect ~6 reps (95% PI: 3-9) - First rep at 0.45 m/s → Expect ~7 reps (95% PI: 3-10)"

    "text": "Limitations\nThis study has several limitations that should be considered:\n\nSample size: With 19 participants, statistical power is limited, particularly for subgroup analyses (e.g., sex differences). Effect sizes may be imprecise.\nExercise specificity: All findings apply specifically to the conventional deadlift. Sumo deadlifts, trap bar deadlifts, and other exercises may show different patterns.\nLoad range: Only 80% and 90% 1RM were tested. Lighter loads commonly used in hypertrophy training (60-75% 1RM) may exhibit different velocity dynamics.\nShort-term reliability only: With only 2 testing days, we cannot assess longer-term reliability (week-to-week, month-to-month) or the effects of training adaptations on velocity profiles.\nPopulation specificity: All participants were Portuguese resistance-trained individuals. Results may not generalize to different populations, training backgrounds, or skill levels (e.g., novice lifters).\nPrediction intervals: The failure prediction lookup table is based on this sample only. Individual athletes may show systematic deviations from these population averages."

    "text": "Conformal Prediction Intervals\n\nThe Problem with Parametric Intervals\nTraditional prediction intervals assume the residuals are normally distributed and homoscedastic (constant variance). As our diagnostic plots show, these assumptions may be violated. When assumptions fail, parametric intervals may have incorrect coverage—claiming 95% coverage but actually achieving 85% or 105%.\n\n\nThe Conformal Prediction Solution\nConformal prediction (Vovk et al., 2005; Lei et al., 2018) provides distribution-free intervals with guaranteed finite-sample coverage. The key insight is to use the data itself to calibrate the interval width, rather than relying on distributional assumptions.\n\n\nMethod\nWe use split conformal prediction:\n\nSplit data: Day 1 (calibration), Day 2 (test)\nFit model on calibration set\nCalculate nonconformity scores: Absolute residuals on calibration set\nFind threshold: The 95th percentile of nonconformity scores\nConstruct intervals: For new predictions, add/subtract the threshold\n\nThis procedure guarantees that if calibration and test data are exchangeable, coverage will be at least 95% in expectation.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nShow code\nconf &lt;- results$conformal\n\ncomparison_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  Metric = c(\"Target Coverage\", \"Empirical Coverage\", \"Average Interval Width\"),\n  Parametric = c(\n    \"95%\",\n    sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", conf$comparison$parametric_coverage * 100),\n    sprintf(\"%.4f m/s\", conf$comparison$parametric_width)\n  ),\n  Conformal = c(\n    \"95%\",\n    sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", conf$comparison$conformal_coverage * 100),\n    sprintf(\"%.4f m/s\", conf$comparison$conformal_width)\n  )\n)\n\nkable(comparison_df, col.names = c(\"Metric\", \"Parametric\", \"Conformal\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Conformal vs Parametric Prediction Intervals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nParametric\nConformal\n\n\n\n\nTarget Coverage\n95%\n95%\n\n\nEmpirical Coverage\n83.4%\n95.6%\n\n\nAverage Interval Width\n0.2114 m/s\n0.2094 m/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Insight:\n\nParametric coverage: 83.4% (deviation from 95%: 11.6%)\nConformal coverage: 95.6% (deviation from 95%: 0.6%)\n\n\n\nShow code\nif (abs(results$conformal$comparison$conformal_coverage -

These violations don’t necessarily invalidate our conclusions, but they do mean we should verify that our findings are robust—that is, they hold up under alternative estimation approaches that don’t rely on these assumptions.\nWe perform three complementary robustness checks:\n\nCluster-Robust Standard Errors: Handle heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance)\nBootstrap Confidence Intervals: Provide assumption-free intervals\nSensitivity Analysis: Test robustness to model specification\n\n\n\nCluster-Robust Standard Errors\n\nWhat This Tests\nStandard LMM standard errors assume that residual variance is constant across all observations (homoscedasticity). If this assumption is violated (e.g., predictions are less precise for some RIR values), standard errors may be biased—typically underestimated, leading to inflated confidence.\n\n\nThe Method\nThe CR2 (bias-reduced) sandwich estimator (Pustejovsky & Tipton, 2018) provides standard errors that are valid regardless of the true variance structure.

The finding that load doesn’t matter may not extend to lighter loads (60-70%) where more repetitions are performed and fatigue dynamics differ.\nExercise specificity: Results apply specifically to the conventional deadlift. Other deadlift variants (sumo, trap bar) and other exercises may show different patterns.\nPopulation specificity: All participants were Portuguese resistance-trained individuals. Generalization to other populations requires caution.\nAssumption violations: Some model diagnostics showed violations of normality and homoscedasticity assumptions. While robust analyses confirmed main conclusions, these violations warrant attention.\nCross-day only: Conformal prediction was validated on Day 2 data only. Longer-term validity (week-to-week) was not tested."

    "text": "Results\n\nThe Velocity-RIR Relationship\nAs lifters approach failure, their bar speed decreases.

However, the scatter is notably larger than typically reported for squat data (Jukic et al., 2024), particularly at 80% 1RM where more repetitions are performed.\n\n\nGeneral vs Individual Models\nA central question in VBT research is whether population-level (“general”) equations suffice, or whether individual calibration is necessary. This has important practical implications: general equations are convenient but may sacrifice accuracy, while individual models require calibration testing but offer personalized thresholds.\n\n\nShow code\ncomparison_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  `Model Type` = c(\"General (Polynomial)\", \"Individual (Polynomial)\"),\n  `R²` = c(\n    round(results$comparison$general_r2, 3),\n    round(results$comparison$individual_r2, 3)\n  ),\n  `Interpretation` = c(\n    paste0(\"Explains ~\", round(results$comparison$general_r2 * 100), \"% of variance\"),\n    paste0(\"Explains ~\", round(results$comparison$individual_r2 * 100), \"% of variance\")\n  )\n)\n\nknitr::kable(comparison_df, col.names = c(\"Model Type\", \"Median R²\", \"Interpretation\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Model Fit Comparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Type\nMedian R²\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nGeneral (Polynomial)\n0.362\nExplains ~36% of variance\n\n\nIndividual (Polynomial)\n0.707\nExplains ~71% of variance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Finding: Individual models explain 2x more variance than general models, consistent with findings from squat research (Jukic et al., 2024). This substantial improvement justifies the additional effort of individual calibration for serious athletes.\n\n\nExercise Comparison: Deadlift vs Squat\nTo contextualize these findings, we compared our deadlift results with the squat data from Jukic et al. (2024), which we replicated in Study 3:\n\n\nShow code\nexercise_comparison &lt;- data.frame(\n  Metric = c(\n    \"Participants\",\n    \"Load Types\",\n    \"General R² (polynomial)\",\n    \"Individual R² (median)\",\n    \"Improvement Factor\"\n  ),\n  Squat = c(\n    \"46\",\n    \"70%, 80%, 90%\",\n    round(squat_results$comparison$general_r2, 2),\n    round(squat_results$comparison$individual_r2, 2),\n    paste0(round(squat_results$comparison$improvement_factor, 2), \"x\")\n  ),\n  Deadlift = c(\n    as.character(results$summary$n_participants),\n    \"80%, 90%\",\n    round(results$comparison$general_r2, 2),\n    round(results$comparison$individual_r2, 2),\n    paste0(round(results$comparison$improvement_factor, 2), \"x\")\n  )\n)\n\nknitr::kable(exercise_comparison, col.names = c(\"Metric\", \"Squat (Jukic)\", \"Deadlift (Thesis)\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Deadlift vs Squat RIR-Velocity Relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nSquat (Jukic)\nDeadlift (Thesis)\n\n\n\n\nParticipants\n46\n19\n\n\nLoad Types\n70%, 80%, 90%\n80%, 90%\n\n\nGeneral R² (polynomial)\n0.5\n0.36\n\n\nIndividual R² (median)\n0.88\n0.71\n\n\nImprovement Factor\n1.78x\n1.95x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is Deadlift R² Lower?\nThe deadlift shows lower R² values than the squat. Several biomechanical and methodological factors may explain this difference:\n\nBinary failure pattern: Deadlifts tend to fail suddenly rather than gradually grinding to a halt. In the squat, athletes often experience progressive bar speed reduction and can “grind” through difficult reps. In contrast, deadlifts either leave the floor or they don’t—there’s less intermediate velocity signal.\nGrip fatigue as an independent limiter: When grip fails, velocity may not accurately reflect lower body fatigue. An athlete might have several reps remaining in their posterior chain but be limited by forearm endurance. This introduces noise uncorrelated with true RIR.\nAbsence of stretch-shortening cycle: The squat’s eccentric phase stores elastic energy that contributes to the concentric portion, creating consistent velocity patterns. The deadlift’s dead-start eliminates this mechanism, potentially increasing rep-to-rep variability.\nTechnical breakdown patterns: As fatigue accumulates, deadlift technique often deteriorates (increased thoracic flexion, hips rising faster than shoulders). These technique changes may affect velocity differently than pure muscular fatigue.\nSample size differences: Our sample (n=19) is smaller than the squat study (n=46), reducing statistical power and potentially inflating variance estimates.\n\n\n\nCross-Day Prediction Accuracy\nA critical test of any VBT model is its ability to predict performance on novel occasions.

This uncertainty should be factored into training prescription, with conservative targets (e.g., targeting RIR 3 if the goal is to stay above RIR 1).\n\n\nVelocity Characteristics by Load\n\n\nShow code\nggplot(data, aes(x = factor(rir), y = mean_velocity, fill = load_percentage)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5, outlier.shape = NA, width = 0.7) +\n  geom_point(\n    aes(color = load_percentage),\n    position = position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.15, dodge.width = 0.7),\n    alpha = 0.6, size = 1.5\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Repetitions in Reserve\",\n    y = \"Mean Velocity (m/s)\",\n    fill = \"Load\",\n    color = \"Load\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#E69F00\", \"#009E73\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#CC7A00\", \"#007A5E\")) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 0.7)),\n         color = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Velocity distribution by load and RIR with individual observations\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: - Higher load (90%) = lower velocities overall - Clear velocity decrease as RIR approaches 0 - Wide variability between individuals at the same RIR"

    "text": "Discussion\n\nPractical Implications for Deadlift Training\nBased on these findings, we offer the following recommendations for implementing VBT with the conventional deadlift:\n\n1. Individual Calibration is Essential\nGeneral population equations lose significant precision. Athletes serious about using VBT for deadlift training should:\n\nPerform a calibration test to failure at submaximal loads (75-85% 1RM)\nEstablish their personal velocity-RIR curve\nRe-calibrate every 4-8 weeks or after significant training blocks\n\n\n\n2. Accept Greater Prediction Uncertainty\nThe deadlift shows ~1.4 rep prediction error compared to ~1 rep for squats. Practical implications:\n\nTarget conservatively: If aiming for RIR 2, use velocity thresholds corresponding to RIR 3\nUse velocity as a guide, not an absolute: Combine with RPE and other autoregulation tools\nDon’t rely solely on velocity for competition peaking: Technical and psychological factors become more important\n\n\n\n3.

    "text": "Limitations\nThis study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results:\n\nSample size: With 19 participants (vs 46 in the squat study), statistical power is limited. Effect sizes are more variable and confidence intervals are wider than ideal.\nLoad range: Only 80% and 90% of 1RM were tested. Lighter loads (60-70%) commonly used in hypertrophy-focused training may show different velocity-RIR patterns.\nPopulation specificity: All participants were Portuguese resistance-trained individuals. Results may not generalize to different populations, training backgrounds, or anthropometrics.\nSingle exercise variant: Only the conventional deadlift was tested. Sumo deadlifts, trap bar deadlifts, and Romanian deadlifts may show different velocity-RIR relationships.\nEquipment specificity: A specific linear position transducer was used. Different velocity measurement devices may yield slightly different values.\nShort-term reliability only: Testing occurred across only 2 days. Longer-term reliability (week-to-week, month-to-month) was not assessed."
