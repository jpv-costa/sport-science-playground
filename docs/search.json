    "text": "1. Introduction\n\n1.1 Background\nVelocity-Based Training (VBT) has emerged as an objective method for monitoring and prescribing resistance training intensity. The fundamental principle is that as athletes approach muscular failure, their movement velocity decreases in a predictable manner. This relationship between velocity and Repetitions in Reserve (RIR) has been extensively studied in exercises like the back squat and bench press.\nThe theoretical foundation for VBT rests on the force-velocity relationship: as fatigue accumulates, the maximum force a muscle can produce decreases, resulting in slower movement at any given load. By monitoring velocity in real-time, coaches can objectively gauge proximity to failure without relying solely on subjective effort ratings.\n\n\n1.2 The Deadlift Challenge\nThe conventional deadlift presents unique biomechanical characteristics that may affect the velocity-RIR relationship:\n\nConcentric-only initiation: Unlike the squat, the deadlift begins from a dead stop without an eccentric-concentric stretch-shortening cycle, eliminating the elastic energy contribution\nGrip as a limiting factor: The grip can become a limiting factor independent of the target musculature (posterior chain), potentially causing failure before true muscular exhaustion\nBinary failure pattern: Deadlifts tend to fail more abruptly—either the bar leaves the floor or it doesn’t—compared to the gradual “grinding” often seen in squats\nLonger lever arms: The horizontal distance between the load and hip joint creates substantial moment arms that change throughout the lift\n\n\n\n1.3 Research Questions\nThis thesis research addresses six key questions:\n\nDoes a meaningful velocity-RIR relationship exist for deadlifts?\nDo individual models outperform general equations?\nDoes load percentage affect the velocity-RIR relationship?\nHow variable is the minimum velocity threshold (MVT) across individuals?\nHow reliable are individual velocity profiles across testing days?\nCan first-rep velocity predict set capacity?"

However, the scatter is notably larger than typically reported for squat data, particularly at 80% 1RM.\n\n\n3.2 General vs Individual Models\n\n\nShow code\ncomparison_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  `Model Type` = c(\"General (Polynomial)\", \"Individual (Polynomial)\"),\n  `R²` = c(\n    round(deadlift_results$comparison$general_r2, 3),\n    round(deadlift_results$comparison$individual_r2, 3)\n  ),\n  `Interpretation` = c(\n    paste0(\"Explains ~\", round(deadlift_results$comparison$general_r2 * 100), \"% of variance\"),\n    paste0(\"Explains ~\", round(deadlift_results$comparison$individual_r2 * 100), \"% of variance\")\n  ),\n  check.names = FALSE\n)\n\nformat_table(comparison_df)\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Model Fit Comparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral (Polynomial)\n0.362\nExplains ~36% of variance\n\n\nIndividual (Polynomial)\n0.707\nExplains ~71% of variance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Finding: Individual models explain 2x more variance than general models, consistent with squat research.

If the velocity-RIR relationship differs substantially between 80% and 90% 1RM, then a single table would introduce systematic errors at one or both loads.\n\n\nThe Method\nTo test whether load percentage affects the velocity-RIR relationship, we used a Linear Mixed Effects Model (LMM) with likelihood ratio testing:\n\nNull Model: Velocity ~ RIR + (1 + RIR | participant)\n\nAssumes load percentage has no effect\n\nAlternative Model: Velocity ~ RIR × Load + (1 + RIR | participant)\n\nAllows separate slopes for each load\n\n\nThe models were compared using a likelihood ratio test (LRT). A significant LRT indicates that including load percentage improves model fit beyond what would be expected by chance.\nWhy LMM? Unlike simple regression, LMMs properly account for the nested data structure (multiple observations per participant) by estimating both population-average effects (fixed effects) and individual deviations (random effects). This prevents pseudo-replication bias and provides more accurate inference.\n\n\nThe Finding\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$load_importance_result)) {\n  load_result &lt;- lmm_results$load_importance_result\n\n  if (isTRUE(load_result$recommendation == \"global\")) {\n    cat(\"**Result**: Load percentage does NOT significantly affect the velocity-RIR relationship.\\n\\n\")\n    if (!is.null(load_result$lr_stat) && is.numeric(load_result$lr_stat)) {\n      cat(\"- Likelihood ratio test: χ² =\", round(as.numeric(load_result$lr_stat), 2), \", p =\", format_p(as.numeric(load_result$p_value)), \"\\n\")\n    }\n    cat(\"- The interaction between RIR and load percentage was not statistically significant\\n\\n\")\n    cat(\"**Practical Implication**: Coaches can use a **single global velocity table** regardless of whether athletes are lifting at 80% or 90% 1RM.

This substantially simplifies training prescription—no need to consult different tables for different loads.\n\n\n\n3.5 Velocity Stop Tables\n\nWhat Are Velocity Stop Tables?\nA velocity stop table provides target velocities for each RIR level. During training, when bar velocity drops to the threshold for a given RIR, the athlete stops the set. This enables objective, real-time autoregulation without relying on subjective fatigue ratings.\n\n\nHow Were These Tables Generated?\nThe tables were generated using Linear Mixed Effects Model predictions:\n\nModel specification:\n\nFixed effect: RIR (the predictor)\nRandom effects: Participant-specific intercepts and slopes\nThis accounts for both the population-average relationship and individual variation\n\nPrediction generation:\n\nFor each RIR value (0-5), we predicted the expected velocity using the fixed effects\n95% confidence intervals were computed from the fixed effects standard errors\nThese intervals represent uncertainty in the population-average relationship\n\nConformal prediction (if available):\n\nAdditionally, we computed conformal prediction intervals that provide distribution-free coverage guarantees\nThese intervals are more conservative and account for both model uncertainty and individual variation\n\n\nWhy this approach? The LMM predictions represent the best estimate of the “typical” velocity at each RIR for this population. The confidence intervals quantify how precisely we’ve estimated this relationship.\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(lmm_results)) {\n  vt &lt;- lmm_results$velocity_table$table\n\n  if (\"load_percentage\" %in% names(vt)) {\n    vt$velocity &lt;- round(vt$velocity, 3)\n    vt$lower_95 &lt;- round(vt$lower_95, 3)\n    vt$upper_95 &lt;- round(vt$upper_95, 3)\n    format_table(vt[, c(\"rir\", \"load_percentage\", \"velocity\", \"lower_95\", \"upper_95\")],\n          col.names = c(\"RIR\", \"Load\", \"Velocity (m/s)\", \"Lower 95%\", \"Upper 95%\"))\n  } else {\n    vt$velocity &lt;- round(vt$velocity, 3)\n    vt$lower_95 &lt;- round(vt$lower_95, 3)\n    vt$upper_95 &lt;- round(vt$upper_95, 3)\n    format_table(vt[, c(\"rir\", \"velocity\", \"lower_95\", \"upper_95\")],\n          col.names = c(\"RIR\", \"Velocity (m/s)\", \"Lower 95%\", \"Upper 95%\"))\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Velocity Stop Table: Target velocities for each RIR level\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRIR\nVelocity (m/s)\nLower 95%\nUpper 95%\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.215\n0.114\n0.317\n\n\n1\n0.244\n0.143\n0.346\n\n\n2\n0.274\n0.172\n0.375\n\n\n3\n0.303\n0.201\n0.404\n\n\n4\n0.332\n0.231\n0.433\n\n\n5\n0.361\n0.260\n0.463\n\n\n6\n0.390\n0.289\n0.492\n\n\n7\n0.420\n0.318\n0.521\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Use This Table:\n\nMonitor bar velocity in real-time during training\nStop the set when velocity drops to your target RIR threshold\nExample: To leave 2 reps in reserve, stop when velocity reaches the corresponding threshold\n\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(lmm_results)) {\n  vt &lt;- lmm_results$velocity_table$table\n\n  if (\"load_percentage\" %in% names(vt)) {\n    ggplot(vt, aes(x = rir, y = velocity, color = load_percentage)) +\n      geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\n      geom_point(size = 3) +\n      geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_95, ymax = upper_95, fill = load_percentage),\n                  alpha = 0.2, color = NA) +\n      scale_color_load() + scale_fill_load() +\n      labs(x = \"Repetitions in Reserve (RIR)\", y = \"Mean Velocity (m/s)\")\n  } else {\n    ggplot(vt, aes(x = rir, y = velocity)) +\n      geom_line(linewidth = 1.2, color = COLORS$primary) +\n      geom_point(size = 3, color = COLORS$primary) +\n      geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_95, ymax = upper_95),\n                  alpha = 0.2, fill = COLORS$primary) +\n      labs(x = \"Repetitions in Reserve (RIR)\", y = \"Mean Velocity (m/s)\",\n           title = \"Global Velocity Stop Table for Deadlift\")\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Velocity Stop Thresholds by RIR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6 Individual vs General Table Accuracy\n\nThe Question\nDoes individual calibration meaningfully improve prediction accuracy compared to the general population table? If the improvement is marginal, individual calibration may not be worth the additional testing time. If substantial, it’s essential for serious athletes.\n\n\nThe Method\nWe compared two approaches using out-of-sample prediction error:\n\nGeneral (Population) Table: Uses the LMM fixed effects only—the same velocity targets for everyone\nIndividual (Calibrated) Table: Uses LMM fixed effects + random effects (BLUPs)—personalized velocity targets\n\nMetrics:\n\nMAE (Mean Absolute Error): Average velocity prediction error in mm/s\nRMSE (Root Mean Square Error): Penalizes larger errors more heavily\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(lmm_results)) {\n  ic &lt;- lmm_results$individual_comparison\n\n  comparison_df &lt;- data.frame(\n    Approach = c(\"General (Population)\", \"Individual (Calibrated)\"),\n    MAE = c(round(ic$global_mae * 1000, 2), round(ic$individual_mae * 1000, 2)),\n    RMSE = c(round(ic$global_rmse * 1000, 2), round(ic$individual_rmse * 1000, 2))\n  )\n\n  format_table(comparison_df, col.names = c(\"Approach\", \"MAE (mm/s)\", \"RMSE (mm/s)\"))\n\n  cat(\"\\n**Improvement from individualization**:\", round(ic$mae_improvement_pct, 1), \"%\\n\")\n}\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: General vs Individual Table Accuracy\n\n\n\n\n**Improvement from individualization**: 34 %\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Finding\nIndividual calibration reduces prediction error by approximately 34%. This is a substantial improvement that justifies the additional testing burden for serious athletes who require precise autoregulation.\nPractical Implication: The general table is a reasonable starting point for recreational lifters, but competitive athletes should invest in individual calibration sessions.\n\n\n\n3.7 Conformal Prediction Intervals\n\nThe Question\nStandard confidence intervals assume normality and may underestimate prediction uncertainty. Can we provide distribution-free prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage for new observations?\n\n\nThe Method\nWe applied conformal prediction (Vovk, Gammerman, and Shafer 2005), a distribution-free method for constructing prediction intervals with finite-sample coverage guarantees:\n\nPrinciple: Instead of assuming a parametric distribution, conformal prediction uses the empirical distribution of residuals to construct intervals\nCoverage guarantee: For a target coverage level α (e.g., 90%), the interval will contain the true value at least α% of the time, regardless of the underlying distribution\nImplementation: We used the cfml approach which computes intervals based on the absolute residuals from the fitted model\n\nWhy conformal prediction? Traditional 95% CI from LMMs estimate uncertainty in the mean response. Conformal intervals estimate uncertainty for individual observations—more relevant for practical training prescription.\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$conformal)) {\n  conf &lt;- lmm_results$conformal\n  cat(\"**Conformal Prediction Results:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Target coverage:\", conf$target_coverage * 100, \"%\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Empirical coverage:\", round(conf$empirical_coverage * 100, 1), \"%\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Mean interval width:\", round(conf$mean_interval_width * 1000, 1), \"mm/s\\n\")\n\n  if (!is.null(conf$intervals)) {\n    cat(\"\\n**Velocity Intervals by RIR (90% Conformal):**\\n\\n\")\n    cat(\"| RIR | Point Estimate | Lower | Upper | Width |\\n\")\n    cat(\"|-----|----------------|-------|-------|-------|\\n\")\n    for (i in seq_len(nrow(conf$intervals))) {\n      row &lt;- conf$intervals[i, ]\n      cat(sprintf(\"| %d | %.3f m/s | %.3f | %.3f | %.0f mm/s |\\n\",\n                  row$rir, row$predicted, row$lower, row$upper,\n                  (row$upper - row$lower) * 1000))\n    }\n  }\n} else {\n  cat(\"*Conformal prediction intervals will be available after running the full analysis pipeline.*\\n\")\n}\n\nConformal Prediction Results:\n\nTarget coverage: %\nEmpirical coverage: %\nMean interval width: mm/s\n\n\n\nThe Finding\nConformal intervals are wider than standard CIs because they account for individual prediction uncertainty, not just uncertainty in the population mean. This is the honest uncertainty when applying velocity thresholds to a new athlete.\nPractical Implication: When using velocity thresholds, athletes should use the conformal interval bounds to make conservative stopping decisions. If aiming for RIR 2, consider stopping at the upper bound of the RIR 2 interval rather than the point estimate."

Advanced Analyses\n\n4.1 Minimum Velocity Threshold (MVT) Variability\n\nThe Question\nThe Minimum Velocity Threshold (MVT) is the velocity at which an athlete can no longer complete a repetition (RIR = 0).

Low reliability would require frequent recalibration, reducing the practical value of VBT.\n\n\nThe Method\nWe assessed reliability using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) (Shrout and Fleiss 1979; Koo and Li 2016):\n\nICC(2,1): Two-way random effects model, single measurement—the standard for test-retest reliability\nParameters assessed:\n\nVelocity-RIR slope (sensitivity of velocity to fatigue)\nMVT (velocity at failure)\n\n\nInterpretation Guidelines (Koo and Li 2016):\n\nICC &lt; 0.50: Poor reliability\nICC 0.50-0.75: Moderate reliability\nICC 0.75-0.90: Good reliability\nICC &gt; 0.90: Excellent reliability\n\nAdditional Metrics:\n\nSEM (Standard Error of Measurement): Expected test-retest variability in same units as measurement\nMDC95 (Minimal Detectable Change): The smallest change that exceeds measurement error with 95% confidence\n\n\n\nThe Finding\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results)) {\n  rel &lt;- advanced_results$reliability\n  cat(\"**Reliability Results:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Parameter | ICC | 95% CI | Interpretation |\\n\")\n  cat(\"|-----------|-----|--------|----------------|\\n\")\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Velocity-RIR Slope | %.2f | [%.2f, %.2f] | %s |\\n\",\n              rel$slope_icc$icc, rel$slope_icc$ci_lower, rel$slope_icc$ci_upper, rel$slope_icc$interpretation))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| MVT | %.2f | [%.2f, %.2f] | %s |\\n\",\n              rel$mvt_icc$icc, rel$mvt_icc$ci_lower, rel$mvt_icc$ci_upper, rel$mvt_icc$interpretation))\n  cat(\"\\n**Measurement Error:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"- SEM:\", round(rel$mvt_icc$sem * 1000, 1), \"mm/s\\n\")\n  cat(\"- MDC95:\", round(rel$mvt_icc$mdc95 * 1000, 1), \"mm/s\\n\")\n  cat(\"\\n*Interpretation: A velocity change of at least\", round(rel$mvt_icc$mdc95 * 1000, 1), \"mm/s is needed to be confident it's a real change, not measurement noise.*\\n\")\n}\n\nReliability Results:\n\n\n\nParameter\nICC\n95% CI\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nVelocity-RIR Slope\n0.72\n[0.64, 0.80]\nModerate\n\n\nMVT\n0.50\n[0.38, 0.62]\nPoor\n\n\n\nMeasurement Error:\n\nSEM: 24 mm/s\nMDC95: 66.6 mm/s\n\nInterpretation: A velocity change of at least 66.6 mm/s is needed to be confident it’s a real change, not measurement noise.\nPractical Recommendation: The moderate reliability suggests that velocity profiles are reasonably stable but not perfect. Recalibrate every 2-4 weeks or after significant training blocks, illness, or competition.\n\n\n\n4.3 Linear vs Polynomial Models\n\nThe Question\nThe velocity-RIR relationship could be linear (constant velocity loss per rep) or curvilinear (accelerating velocity loss near failure). Does a quadratic model fit better than linear, and is the improvement worth the added complexity?\n\n\nThe Method\nFor each participant, we fit both models and compared them:\n\nLinear: Velocity = β₀ + β₁ × RIR\nQuadratic: Velocity = β₀ + β₁ × RIR + β₂ × RIR²\n\nModel Selection Criteria:\n\nAIC (Akaike Information Criterion): Balances fit against complexity; lower is better\nR² improvement: How much additional variance is explained by the quadratic term\n\nDecision Rule: Quadratic is “better” if AIC is lower by ≥2 points (meaningful improvement) AND R² improves by ≥0.01.\n\n\nThe Finding\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results)) {\n  poly &lt;- advanced_results$polynomial_comparison\n  cat(\"**Model Comparison Results:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Metric | Value |\\n\")\n  cat(\"|--------|-------|\\n\")\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Participants analyzed | %d |\\n\", poly$best_model_summary$n_participants))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Linear model preferred | %d (%.0f%%) |\\n\",\n              poly$best_model_summary$n_linear_best,\n              100 - poly$best_model_summary$pct_quad_best))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Quadratic model preferred | %d (%.0f%%) |\\n\",\n              poly$best_model_summary$n_quad_best,\n              poly$best_model_summary$pct_quad_best))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Average R² improvement (quadratic) | %.4f |\\n\", poly$best_model_summary$avg_r2_improvement))\n}\n\nModel Comparison Results:\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue\n\n\n\n\nParticipants analyzed\n19\n\n\nLinear model preferred\n14 (74%)\n\n\nQuadratic model preferred\n5 (26%)\n\n\nAverage R² improvement (quadratic)\n0.0164\n\n\n\nInterpretation: For the majority of participants, the linear model is sufficient. The quadratic term provides only marginal improvement (&lt; 1% R² gain on average). This simplifies practical application—coaches can use a simple linear relationship without sacrificing meaningful accuracy.\nPractical Implication: Use linear velocity tables. The small theoretical improvement from polynomial models is not worth the added complexity for training prescription.\n\n\n\n4.4 Velocity Decay Patterns\n\nThe Question\nDoes velocity loss occur at a constant rate throughout a set, or does it accelerate as failure approaches? Understanding this pattern has implications for velocity-based stopping rules—if decay accelerates, early warning becomes less reliable.\n\n\nThe Method\nWe analyzed within-set velocity decay by:\n\nPhase comparison: Comparing velocity loss in the first half vs. second half of each set\nStatistical test: Paired t-test to determine if second-half decay is significantly greater\n\nHypotheses:\n\nH₀: Decay rate is constant (first half = second half)\nH₁: Decay accelerates (second half &gt; first half)\n\n\n\nThe Finding\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$velocity_decay)) {\n  decay &lt;- advanced_results$velocity_decay\n  cat(\"**Velocity Decay Results:**\\n\\n\")\n  if (!is.null(decay$phase_decay)) {\n    cat(\"| Set Phase | Velocity Loss (m/s per rep) |\\n\")\n    cat(\"|-----------|-----------------------------|\\n\")\n    cat(sprintf(\"| First half | %.4f |\\n\", as.numeric(decay$phase_decay$first_half_decay)))\n    cat(sprintf(\"| Second half | %.4f |\\n\", as.numeric(decay$phase_decay$second_half_decay)))\n    cat(\"\\n\")\n  }\n  if (!is.null(decay$decay_acceleration)) {\n    if (isTRUE(decay$decay_acceleration$accelerating)) {\n      cat(sprintf(\"**Statistical Test:** Decay significantly accelerates near failure (p = %s)\\n\\n\",\n                  format(decay$decay_acceleration$p_value, digits = 3)))\n      cat(\"The velocity-fatigue curve is **exponential**, not linear. This means:\\n\\n\")\n      cat(\"1. Early reps provide less warning of impending failure\\n\")\n      cat(\"2. The final 2-3 reps show rapid velocity decline\\n\")\n      cat(\"3.

This means:\n\nEarly reps provide less warning of impending failure\nThe final 2-3 reps show rapid velocity decline\nConservative velocity thresholds are advisable\n\nPractical Implication: Because velocity loss accelerates near failure, athletes should use conservative stopping thresholds. If targeting RIR 2, consider stopping at the RIR 3 threshold to account for the acceleration effect.\n\n\n\n4.5 First-Rep Failure Prediction\n\nThe Question\nCan we predict how many reps until failure from just the first 1-3 repetitions? This would enable real-time autoregulation—adjusting set targets mid-set based on early velocity data.\n\n\nThe Method\nWe built a prediction model using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2009):\n\nPredictor: First-rep velocity (m/s)\nOutcome: Total reps to failure\nModel: Linear regression (velocity → rep capacity)\nValidation: Each set held out once; model trained on remaining sets\n\nWhy LOOCV? It provides an unbiased estimate of out-of-sample prediction error. Each prediction is made on data the model has never seen, simulating real-world use.\nMetrics:\n\nMAE: Average absolute error in rep prediction (in reps)\nRMSE: Root mean squared error (penalizes large errors)\nR²: Proportion of variance in rep capacity explained by first-rep velocity\n\n\n\nThe Finding\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results)) {\n  pred &lt;- advanced_results$failure_prediction\n  cat(\"**Prediction Accuracy (Leave-One-Out CV):**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Metric | Value | Interpretation |\\n\")\n  cat(\"|--------|-------|----------------|\\n\")\n  cat(sprintf(\"| MAE | %.2f reps | Average prediction error |\\n\", pred$cv_results$mae))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| RMSE | %.2f reps | Error penalizing outliers |\\n\", pred$cv_results$rmse))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| R² | %.3f | Variance explained |\\n\", pred$cv_results$r2))\n}\n\nPrediction Accuracy (Leave-One-Out CV):\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nMAE\n1.29 reps\nAverage prediction error\n\n\nRMSE\n1.53 reps\nError penalizing outliers\n\n\nR²\n0.065\nVariance explained\n\n\n\nInterpretation: A MAE of ~1-2 reps means that on average, first-rep velocity predicts failure within 1-2 repetitions. This is practically useful for autoregulation—if the model predicts 6 reps to failure, expect 5-7 reps.\nPractical Application: After the first rep, check velocity against the prediction table. If velocity is unusually low (predicting fewer reps than planned), consider reducing set volume. If unusually high, you may have more capacity than expected."
