    "text": "1. Introduction\n\n1.1 Background\nVelocity-Based Training (VBT) has emerged as an objective method for monitoring and prescribing resistance training intensity. The fundamental principle is that as athletes approach muscular failure, their movement velocity decreases in a predictable manner. This relationship between velocity and Repetitions in Reserve (RIR) has been extensively studied in exercises like the back squat and bench press.\nThe theoretical foundation for VBT rests on the force-velocity relationship: as fatigue accumulates, the maximum force a muscle can produce decreases, resulting in slower movement at any given load. By monitoring velocity in real-time, coaches can objectively gauge proximity to failure without relying solely on subjective effort ratings.\n\n\n1.2 The Deadlift Challenge\nThe conventional deadlift presents unique biomechanical characteristics that may affect the velocity-RIR relationship:\n\nConcentric-only initiation: Unlike the squat, the deadlift begins from a dead stop without an eccentric-concentric stretch-shortening cycle, eliminating the elastic energy contribution\nGrip as a limiting factor: The grip can become a limiting factor independent of the target musculature (posterior chain), potentially causing failure before true muscular exhaustion\nBinary failure pattern: Deadlifts tend to fail more abruptly—either the bar leaves the floor or it doesn’t—compared to the gradual “grinding” often seen in squats\nLonger lever arms: The horizontal distance between the load and hip joint creates substantial moment arms that change throughout the lift\n\n\n\n1.3 Research Questions\nThis thesis research addresses six key questions:\n\nDoes a meaningful velocity-RIR relationship exist for deadlifts?\nDo individual models outperform general equations?\nDoes load percentage affect the velocity-RIR relationship?\nHow variable is the minimum velocity threshold (MVT) across individuals?\nHow reliable are individual velocity profiles across testing days?\nCan first-rep velocity predict set capacity?"

If the velocity-RIR relationship differs substantially between 80% and 90% 1RM, then a single table would introduce systematic errors at one or both loads.\n\n\nThe Method\nTo test whether load percentage affects the velocity-RIR relationship, we used a Linear Mixed Effects Model (LMM) with likelihood ratio testing:\n\nNull Model: Velocity ~ RIR + (1 + RIR | participant)\n\nAssumes load percentage has no effect\n\nAlternative Model: Velocity ~ RIR × Load + (1 + RIR | participant)\n\nAllows separate slopes for each load\n\n\nThe models were compared using a likelihood ratio test (LRT). A significant LRT indicates that including load percentage improves model fit beyond what would be expected by chance.\nWhy LMM? Unlike simple regression, LMMs properly account for the nested data structure (multiple observations per participant) by estimating both population-average effects (fixed effects) and individual deviations (random effects). This prevents pseudo-replication bias and provides more accurate inference.\n\n\nThe Finding\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$load_importance_result)) {\n  load_result &lt;- lmm_results$load_importance_result\n\n  if (isTRUE(load_result$recommendation == \"global\")) {\n    cat(\"**Result**: Load percentage does NOT significantly affect the velocity-RIR relationship.\\n\\n\")\n    if (!is.null(load_result$lr_stat) && is.numeric(load_result$lr_stat)) {\n      cat(\"- Likelihood ratio test: χ² =\", round(as.numeric(load_result$lr_stat), 2), \", p =\", format_p(as.numeric(load_result$p_value)), \"\\n\")\n    }\n    cat(\"- The interaction between RIR and load percentage was not statistically significant\\n\\n\")\n    cat(\"**Practical Implication**: Coaches can use a **single global velocity table** regardless of whether athletes are lifting at 80% or 90% 1RM.

This substantially simplifies training prescription—no need to consult different tables for different loads.\n\n\n\n3.5 Velocity Stop Tables\n\nWhat Are Velocity Stop Tables?\nA velocity stop table provides target velocities for each RIR level. During training, when bar velocity drops to the threshold for a given RIR, the athlete stops the set. This enables objective, real-time autoregulation without relying on subjective fatigue ratings.\n\n\nHow Were These Tables Generated?\nThe tables were generated using Linear Mixed Effects Model predictions:\n\nModel specification:\n\nFixed effect: RIR (the predictor)\nRandom effects: Participant-specific intercepts and slopes\nThis accounts for both the population-average relationship and individual variation\n\nPrediction generation:\n\nFor each RIR value (0-5), we predicted the expected velocity using the fixed effects\n95% confidence intervals were computed from the fixed effects standard errors\nThese intervals represent uncertainty in the population-average relationship\n\nConformal prediction (if available):\n\nAdditionally, we computed conformal prediction intervals that provide distribution-free coverage guarantees\nThese intervals are more conservative and account for both model uncertainty and individual variation\n\n\nWhy this approach? The LMM predictions represent the best estimate of the “typical” velocity at each RIR for this population. The confidence intervals quantify how precisely we’ve estimated this relationship.\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(lmm_results)) {\n  vt &lt;- lmm_results$velocity_table$table\n\n  if (\"load_percentage\" %in% names(vt)) {\n    vt$velocity &lt;- round(vt$velocity, 3)\n    vt$lower_95 &lt;- round(vt$lower_95, 3)\n    vt$upper_95 &lt;- round(vt$upper_95, 3)\n    format_table(vt[, c(\"rir\", \"load_percentage\", \"velocity\", \"lower_95\", \"upper_95\")],\n          col.names = c(\"RIR\", \"Load\", \"Velocity (m/s)\", \"Lower 95%\", \"Upper 95%\"))\n  } else {\n    vt$velocity &lt;- round(vt$velocity, 3)\n    vt$lower_95 &lt;- round(vt$lower_95, 3)\n    vt$upper_95 &lt;- round(vt$upper_95, 3)\n    format_table(vt[, c(\"rir\", \"velocity\", \"lower_95\", \"upper_95\")],\n          col.names = c(\"RIR\", \"Velocity (m/s)\", \"Lower 95%\", \"Upper 95%\"))\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Velocity Stop Table: Target velocities for each RIR level\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRIR\nVelocity (m/s)\nLower 95%\nUpper 95%\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.215\n0.114\n0.317\n\n\n1\n0.244\n0.143\n0.346\n\n\n2\n0.274\n0.172\n0.375\n\n\n3\n0.303\n0.201\n0.404\n\n\n4\n0.332\n0.231\n0.433\n\n\n5\n0.361\n0.260\n0.463\n\n\n6\n0.390\n0.289\n0.492\n\n\n7\n0.420\n0.318\n0.521\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Use This Table:\n\nMonitor bar velocity in real-time during training\nStop the set when velocity drops to your target RIR threshold\nExample: To leave 2 reps in reserve, stop when velocity reaches the corresponding threshold\n\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(lmm_results)) {\n  vt &lt;- lmm_results$velocity_table$table\n\n  if (\"load_percentage\" %in% names(vt)) {\n    ggplot(vt, aes(x = rir, y = velocity, color = load_percentage)) +\n      geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\n      geom_point(size = 3) +\n      geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_95, ymax = upper_95, fill = load_percentage),\n                  alpha = 0.2, color = NA) +\n      scale_color_load() + scale_fill_load() +\n      labs(x = \"Repetitions in Reserve (RIR)\", y = \"Mean Velocity (m/s)\")\n  } else {\n    ggplot(vt, aes(x = rir, y = velocity)) +\n      geom_line(linewidth = 1.2, color = COLORS$primary) +\n      geom_point(size = 3, color = COLORS$primary) +\n      geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_95, ymax = upper_95),\n                  alpha = 0.2, fill = COLORS$primary) +\n      labs(x = \"Repetitions in Reserve (RIR)\", y = \"Mean Velocity (m/s)\",\n           title = \"Global Velocity Stop Table for Deadlift\")\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Velocity Stop Thresholds by RIR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6 Individual vs General Table Accuracy\n\nThe Question\nDoes individual calibration meaningfully improve prediction accuracy compared to the general population table? If the improvement is marginal, individual calibration may not be worth the additional testing time. If substantial, it’s essential for serious athletes.\n\n\nThe Method\nWe compared two approaches using out-of-sample prediction error:\n\nGeneral (Population) Table: Uses the LMM fixed effects only—the same velocity targets for everyone\nIndividual (Calibrated) Table: Uses LMM fixed effects + random effects (BLUPs)—personalized velocity targets\n\nMetrics:\n\nMAE (Mean Absolute Error): Average velocity prediction error in mm/s\nRMSE (Root Mean Square Error): Penalizes larger errors more heavily\n\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(lmm_results)) {\n  ic &lt;- lmm_results$individual_comparison\n\n  comparison_df &lt;- data.frame(\n    Approach = c(\"General (Population)\", \"Individual (Calibrated)\"),\n    MAE = c(round(ic$global_mae * 1000, 2), round(ic$individual_mae * 1000, 2)),\n    RMSE = c(round(ic$global_rmse * 1000, 2), round(ic$individual_rmse * 1000, 2))\n  )\n\n  format_table(comparison_df, col.names = c(\"Approach\", \"MAE (mm/s)\", \"RMSE (mm/s)\"))\n}\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: General vs Individual Table Accuracy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproach\nMAE (mm/s)\nRMSE (mm/s)\n\n\n\n\nGeneral (Population)\n59.86\n79.17\n\n\nIndividual (Calibrated)\n39.54\n51.75\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(lmm_results)) {\n  ic &lt;- lmm_results$individual_comparison\n  cat(\"\\n**Improvement from individualization**:\", round(ic$mae_improvement_pct, 1), \"%\\n\")\n}\n\nImprovement from individualization: 34 %\n\n\nThe Finding\nIndividual calibration reduces prediction error by approximately 34%. This is a substantial improvement that justifies the additional testing burden for serious athletes who require precise autoregulation.\nPractical Implication: The general table is a reasonable starting point for recreational lifters, but competitive athletes should invest in individual calibration sessions.\n\n\n\n3.7 Conformal Prediction Intervals\n\nThe Problem with Parametric Intervals\nTraditional prediction intervals assume the residuals are normally distributed and homoscedastic (constant variance). When assumptions fail, parametric intervals may have incorrect coverage—claiming 95% coverage but actually achieving 85% or 105%.\n\n\nThe Conformal Prediction Solution\nConformal prediction (Vovk, Gammerman, and Shafer 2005; Lei et al. 2018) provides distribution-free intervals with guaranteed finite-sample coverage.

Advanced Analyses\n\n4.1 Minimum Velocity Threshold (MVT) Variability\n\nThe Question\nThe Minimum Velocity Threshold (MVT) is the velocity at which an athlete can no longer complete a repetition (RIR = 0). If MVT is consistent across individuals, it could serve as a universal failure indicator—any time velocity drops below this threshold, the set should end. But how variable is MVT across individuals?\n\n\nThe Method\nWe quantified MVT variability using:\n\nCoefficient of Variation (CV): SD/Mean × 100%—a standardized measure of spread\nRange (Min-Max): The full spread of MVT values observed\nIQR: Middle 50% of values, robust to outliers\n\nInterpretation Guidelines:\n\nCV &lt; 10%: Low variability → universal threshold may work\nCV 10-25%: Moderate variability → individual calibration recommended\nCV &gt; 25%: High variability → individual calibration essential\n\n\n\nThe Finding\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results)) {\n  mvt &lt;- advanced_results$mvt\n  cat(\"**Population MVT Statistics:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Mean:\", round(mvt$population_stats$mean, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n  cat(\"- SD:\", round(mvt$population_stats$sd, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n  cat(\"- **CV:**\", round(mvt$population_stats$cv_percent, 1), \"%\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Range:\", round(mvt$population_stats$min, 3), \"-\", round(mvt$population_stats$max, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n}\n\nPopulation MVT Statistics:\n\nMean: 0.206 m/s\nSD: 0.063 m/s\nCV: 30.8 %\nRange: 0.119 - 0.402 m/s\n\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results)) {\n  failure_data &lt;- data[data$rir == 0, ]\n  mvt &lt;- advanced_results$mvt\n\n  ggplot(failure_data, aes(x = mean_velocity)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), bins = 20, fill = COLORS$primary, alpha = 0.7) +\n    geom_density(color = COLORS$secondary, linewidth = 1) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = mvt$population_stats$mean, linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1) +\n    labs(x = \"Velocity at Failure (m/s)\", y = \"Density\",\n         title = \"MVT Distribution Across Failure Observations\")\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Distribution of Minimum Velocity Threshold at failure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$mvt$individual_stats)) {\n  ind_mvt &lt;- advanced_results$mvt$individual_stats\n  ind_mvt &lt;- ind_mvt[order(ind_mvt$mean_mvt), ]\n  ind_mvt$id &lt;- factor(ind_mvt$id, levels = ind_mvt$id)\n\n  ggplot(ind_mvt, aes(x = id, y = mean_mvt, color = sex)) +\n    geom_point(size = 3) +\n    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_mvt - sd_mvt, ymax = mean_mvt + sd_mvt),\n                  width = 0.3) +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = advanced_results$mvt$population_stats$mean,\n               linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray50\") +\n    coord_flip() +\n    labs(x = \"Participant\", y = \"MVT (m/s)\",\n         title = \"Individual MVT with Standard Deviation\",\n         color = \"Sex\") +\n    scale_color_manual(values = c(\"female\" = COLORS$secondary, \"male\" = COLORS$primary))\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Individual MVT values showing between-participant variability\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad Comparison:\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$mvt$load_comparison)) {\n  lc &lt;- advanced_results$mvt$load_comparison\n  cat(\"- 80% 1RM MVT:\", round(lc$load_80_mean, 3), \"±\", round(lc$load_80_sd, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n  cat(\"- 90% 1RM MVT:\", round(lc$load_90_mean, 3), \"±\", round(lc$load_90_sd, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Difference:\", round(lc$difference, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n  cat(\"- p-value:\", format(lc$wilcox_p, digits = 4), \"\\n\")\n  if (lc$significant) {\n    cat(\"- **Significant difference** - MVT varies by load\\n\")\n  } else {\n    cat(\"- No significant load effect - MVT appears consistent across loads\\n\")\n  }\n}\n\n\n80% 1RM MVT: 0.217 ± 0.066 m/s\n90% 1RM MVT: 0.196 ± 0.061 m/s\nDifference: 0.021 m/s\np-value: 0.148\nNo significant load effect - MVT appears consistent across loads\n\nThe CV of 30.8% indicates high inter-individual variability (above the 25% threshold).\nPractical Implication: A universal MVT threshold would misclassify many athletes—some would stop too early (false positive for failure), others too late (missed failure).

Does a quadratic model fit better than linear, and is the improvement worth the added complexity?\n\n\nThe Method\nFor each participant, we fit both models and compared them:\n\nLinear: Velocity = β₀ + β₁ × RIR\nQuadratic: Velocity = β₀ + β₁ × RIR + β₂ × RIR²\n\nModel Selection Criteria:\n\nAIC (Akaike Information Criterion): Balances fit against complexity; lower is better\nR² improvement: How much additional variance is explained by the quadratic term\n\nDecision Rule: Quadratic is “better” if AIC is lower by ≥2 points (meaningful improvement) AND R² improves by ≥0.01.\n\n\nThe Finding\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results)) {\n  poly &lt;- advanced_results$polynomial_comparison\n  cat(\"**Model Comparison Results:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Metric | Value |\\n\")\n  cat(\"|--------|-------|\\n\")\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Participants analyzed | %d |\\n\", poly$best_model_summary$n_participants))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Linear model preferred | %d (%.0f%%) |\\n\",\n              poly$best_model_summary$n_linear_best,\n              100 - poly$best_model_summary$pct_quad_best))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Quadratic model preferred | %d (%.0f%%) |\\n\",\n              poly$best_model_summary$n_quad_best,\n              poly$best_model_summary$pct_quad_best))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Average R² improvement (quadratic) | %.4f |\\n\", poly$best_model_summary$avg_r2_improvement))\n}\n\nModel Comparison Results:\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue\n\n\n\n\nParticipants analyzed\n19\n\n\nLinear model preferred\n14 (74%)\n\n\nQuadratic model preferred\n5 (26%)\n\n\nAverage R² improvement (quadratic)\n0.0164\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$polynomial_comparison$individual_results)) {\n  ind_results &lt;- advanced_results$polynomial_comparison$individual_results\n\n  ggplot(ind_results, aes(x = reorder(id, delta_aic), y = delta_aic, fill = best_model)) +\n    geom_col() +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = -2, linetype = \"dashed\", color = COLORS$secondary) +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 2, linetype = \"dashed\", color = COLORS$secondary) +\n    coord_flip() +\n    labs(x = \"Participant\", y = \"ΔAIC (Quadratic - Linear)\",\n         title = \"Model Comparison by Participant\",\n         subtitle = \"Negative values favor quadratic model\",\n         fill = \"Best Model\") +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"linear\" = COLORS$primary, \"quadratic\" = COLORS$tertiary))\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: AIC comparison between linear and quadratic models by participant\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation: For the majority of participants, the linear model is sufficient. The quadratic term provides only marginal improvement (&lt; 1% R² gain on average). This simplifies practical application—coaches can use a simple linear relationship without sacrificing meaningful accuracy.\nPractical Implication: Use linear velocity tables. The small theoretical improvement from polynomial models is not worth the added complexity for training prescription.\n\n\n\n4.4 Velocity Decay Patterns\n\nThe Question\nDoes velocity loss occur at a constant rate throughout a set, or does it accelerate as failure approaches? Understanding this pattern has implications for velocity-based stopping rules—if decay accelerates, early warning becomes less reliable.\n\n\nThe Method\nWe analyzed within-set velocity decay by:\n\nPhase comparison: Comparing velocity loss in the first half vs. second half of each set\nStatistical test: Paired t-test to determine if second-half decay is significantly greater\n\nHypotheses:\n\nH₀: Decay rate is constant (first half = second half)\nH₁: Decay accelerates (second half &gt; first half)\n\n\n\nThe Finding\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$velocity_decay)) {\n  decay &lt;- advanced_results$velocity_decay\n  cat(\"**Velocity Decay Results:**\\n\\n\")\n  if (!is.null(decay$phase_decay)) {\n    cat(\"| Set Phase | Velocity Loss (m/s per rep) |\\n\")\n    cat(\"|-----------|-----------------------------|\\n\")\n    cat(sprintf(\"| First half | %.4f |\\n\", as.numeric(decay$phase_decay$first_half_decay)))\n    cat(sprintf(\"| Second half | %.4f |\\n\", as.numeric(decay$phase_decay$second_half_decay)))\n    cat(\"\\n\")\n  }\n  if (!is.null(decay$decay_acceleration)) {\n    if (isTRUE(decay$decay_acceleration$accelerating)) {\n      cat(sprintf(\"**Statistical Test:** Decay significantly accelerates near failure (p = %s)\\n\\n\",\n                  format(decay$decay_acceleration$p_value, digits = 3)))\n      cat(\"The velocity-fatigue curve is **exponential**, not linear.

If targeting RIR 2, consider stopping at the RIR 3 threshold to account for the acceleration effect.\n\n\n\n4.5 First-Rep Failure Prediction\n\nThe Question\nCan we predict how many reps until failure from just the first 1-3 repetitions? This would enable real-time autoregulation—adjusting set targets mid-set based on early velocity data.\n\n\nThe Method\nWe built a prediction model using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2009):\n\nPredictor: First-rep velocity (m/s)\nOutcome: Total reps to failure\nModel: Linear regression (velocity → rep capacity)\nValidation: Each set held out once; model trained on remaining sets\n\nWhy LOOCV? It provides an unbiased estimate of out-of-sample prediction error. Each prediction is made on data the model has never seen, simulating real-world use.\nMetrics:\n\nMAE: Average absolute error in rep prediction (in reps)\nRMSE: Root mean squared error (penalizes large errors)\nR²: Proportion of variance in rep capacity explained by first-rep velocity\n\n\n\nThe Finding\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results)) {\n  pred &lt;- advanced_results$failure_prediction\n  cat(\"**Prediction Accuracy (Leave-One-Out CV):**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Metric | Value | Interpretation |\\n\")\n  cat(\"|--------|-------|----------------|\\n\")\n  cat(sprintf(\"| MAE | %.2f reps | Average prediction error |\\n\", pred$cv_results$mae))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| RMSE | %.2f reps | Error penalizing outliers |\\n\", pred$cv_results$rmse))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| R² | %.3f | Variance explained |\\n\", pred$cv_results$r2))\n}\n\nPrediction Accuracy (Leave-One-Out CV):\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nMAE\n1.29 reps\nAverage prediction error\n\n\nRMSE\n1.53 reps\nError penalizing outliers\n\n\nR²\n0.065\nVariance explained\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$failure_prediction$lookup_table)) {\n  lookup &lt;- advanced_results$failure_prediction$lookup_table\n  format_table(lookup, digits = 1,\n        col.names = c(\"First Rep Velocity (m/s)\", \"Predicted Reps\", \"Lower 95%\", \"Upper 95%\"))\n}\n\n\n\n\nTable 10: Practical Lookup Table: First Rep Velocity → Predicted Reps\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Rep Velocity (m/s)\nPredicted Reps\nLower 95%\nUpper 95%\n\n\n\n\n0.1\n4.9\n1.8\n8.0\n\n\n0.2\n5.2\n2.1\n8.3\n\n\n0.2\n5.4\n2.4\n8.5\n\n\n0.3\n5.7\n2.6\n8.7\n\n\n0.3\n6.0\n2.9\n9.0\n\n\n0.4\n6.2\n3.2\n9.3\n\n\n0.5\n6.5\n3.4\n9.6\n\n\n0.5\n6.8\n3.7\n9.9\n\n\n0.6\n7.0\n3.9\n10.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(data)) {\n  # Prepare set-level data\n  set_data &lt;- do.call(rbind, lapply(unique(data$set_id), function(sid) {\n    s &lt;- data[data$set_id == sid, ]\n    s &lt;- s[order(s$rep_number), ]\n    if (nrow(s) &lt; 1) return(NULL)\n    data.frame(\n      set_id = sid,\n      v1 = s$mean_velocity[1],\n      reps_to_failure = s$reps_to_failure[1],\n      load_percentage = s$load_percentage[1]\n    )\n  }))\n\n  if (!is.null(set_data) && nrow(set_data) &gt; 0) {\n    ggplot(set_data, aes(x = v1, y = reps_to_failure, color = load_percentage)) +\n      geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +\n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, aes(group = 1), color = \"black\") +\n      labs(x = \"First Rep Velocity (m/s)\", y = \"Total Reps to Failure\",\n           title = \"Relationship Between First Rep Velocity and Set Capacity\",\n           color = \"Load\") +\n      scale_color_load()\n  }\n}\n\n\nInterpretation: A MAE of ~1-2 reps means that on average, first-rep velocity predicts failure within 1-2 repetitions. This is practically useful for autoregulation—if the model predicts 6 reps to failure, expect 5-7 reps.\nPractical Application: After the first rep, check velocity against the prediction table. If velocity is unusually low (predicting fewer reps than planned), consider reducing set volume. If unusually high, you may have more capacity than expected."

These violations don’t necessarily invalidate our conclusions, but they do mean we should verify that our findings are robust—that is, they hold up under alternative estimation approaches that don’t rely on these assumptions.\nWe perform three complementary robustness checks:\n\nCluster-Robust Standard Errors: Handle heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance)\nBootstrap Confidence Intervals: Provide assumption-free intervals\nSensitivity Analysis: Test robustness to model specification\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Cluster-Robust Standard Errors\nWhat This Tests: Standard LMM standard errors assume that residual variance is constant across all observations (homoscedasticity). If this assumption is violated (e.g., predictions are less precise for some RIR values), standard errors may be biased—typically underestimated, leading to inflated confidence.\nThe Method: The CR2 (bias-reduced) sandwich estimator (Pustejovsky and Tipton 2018) provides standard errors that are valid regardless of the true variance structure. We compare these robust SEs to the standard Wald SEs.\nKey Metric: SE Ratio - SE Ratio = Robust SE / Wald SE - Ratio ≈ 1.0: No heteroscedasticity problem - Ratio &gt; 1.5: Standard errors are underestimated—use robust SEs - Ratio &lt; 0.67: Standard errors are overestimated (rare)\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$robust_se)) {\n  robust_df &lt;- lmm_results$robust_se\n  robust_df$estimate &lt;- round(robust_df$estimate, 4)\n  robust_df$se_wald &lt;- round(robust_df$se_wald, 4)\n  robust_df$se_robust &lt;- round(robust_df$se_robust, 4)\n  robust_df$se_ratio &lt;- round(robust_df$se_ratio, 3)\n  robust_df$p_robust &lt;- ifelse(robust_df$p_robust &lt; 0.001, \"&lt;0.001\",\n                               sprintf(\"%.4f\", robust_df$p_robust))\n\n  format_table(robust_df[, c(\"term\", \"estimate\", \"se_wald\", \"se_robust\", \"se_ratio\", \"p_robust\")],\n        col.names = c(\"Term\", \"Estimate\", \"SE (Wald)\", \"SE (Robust)\", \"Ratio\", \"p (Robust)\"))\n} else {\n  cat(\"*Note: Cluster-robust standard errors will be available after running the complete LMM analysis.*\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"**Expected output:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Term | Estimate | SE (Wald) | SE (Robust) | Ratio | p (Robust) |\\n\")\n  cat(\"|------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------|------------|\\n\")\n  cat(\"| (Intercept) | ~0.21 | ~0.015 | ~0.016 | ~1.05 | &lt;0.001 |\\n\")\n  cat(\"| rir | ~0.032 | ~0.004 | ~0.004 | ~1.02 | &lt;0.001 |\\n\")\n}\n\n\n\n\nTable 11: Cluster-Robust Standard Errors vs. Standard Wald Errors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nEstimate\nSE (Wald)\nSE (Robust)\nRatio\np (Robust)\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.215\n0.010\n0.010\n0.999\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nrir\n0.029\n0.004\n0.004\n1.000\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$robust_se)) {\n  robust_df &lt;- lmm_results$robust_se\n  max_ratio &lt;- max(robust_df$se_ratio)\n  min_ratio &lt;- min(robust_df$se_ratio)\n\n  cat(\"\\n**Interpretation:**\\n\\n\")\n\n  if (max_ratio &lt; 1.2 && min_ratio &gt; 0.8) {\n    cat(\"- SE ratios are very close to 1.0 (\",\n        sprintf(\"%.3f to %.3f\", min_ratio, max_ratio),\n        \"), indicating **minimal heteroscedasticity**\\n\")\n    cat(\"- Standard Wald errors are reliable for inference\\n\")\n    cat(\"- Both p-values remain highly significant under robust estimation\\n\")\n  } else if (max_ratio &lt; 1.5) {\n    cat(\"- SE ratios are close to 1.0, indicating **mild heteroscedasticity**\\n\")\n    cat(\"- Standard errors remain reasonably reliable\\n\")\n    cat(\"- P-values are similar under both approaches\\n\")\n  } else {\n    cat(\"- SE ratios differ substantially from 1.0, indicating **substantial heteroscedasticity**\\n\")\n    cat(\"- Robust standard errors should be preferred for inference\\n\")\n    cat(\"- Consider heteroscedasticity-robust models for more accurate prediction intervals\\n\")\n  }\n\n  rir_row &lt;- robust_df[robust_df$term == \"rir\", ]\n  cat(\"\\n**Key Result**: The RIR effect (\", sprintf(\"%.4f\", rir_row$estimate),\n      \" m/s per RIR) remains highly significant (p \", rir_row$p_robust,\n      \") under robust estimation.\\n\")\n}\n\nInterpretation:\n\nSE ratios are very close to 1.0 ( 0.999 to 1.000 ), indicating minimal heteroscedasticity\nStandard Wald errors are reliable for inference\nBoth p-values remain highly significant under robust estimation\n\nKey Result: The RIR effect ( 0.0292 m/s per RIR) remains highly significant (p 0.0000001296 ) under robust estimation.\n\n\n5.2.2 Bootstrap Confidence Intervals\nWhat This Tests: Parametric bootstrap provides assumption-free confidence intervals by simulating the sampling distribution directly from the fitted model.

Conclusion\nThis thesis research demonstrates that velocity-based training principles can be applied to the conventional deadlift, though with important caveats:\n\nVBT works for deadlifts but with more variability than other exercises\nIndividual calibration is essential due to high inter-individual variability\nPractical velocity tables can guide training, but should be used alongside other autoregulation tools\nPeriodic recalibration is recommended given moderate day-to-day reliability\n\nFor coaches and athletes, VBT offers an objective complement to RPE-based autoregulation for the deadlift, but should not be used as the sole prescription tool."
