    "text": "The squat study (Study 3) showed that bar velocity can predict Repetitions in Reserve (RIR) with high accuracy—especially when using individual calibration. But does this relationship hold for the deadlift?\nThe deadlift presents unique challenges:\n\nNo eccentric phase at the start (bar starts from the floor)\nGrip fatigue can limit performance independently of target muscles\nMore binary failure pattern (you can lift it or you can’t)\n\nThis study examines whether velocity-based training principles apply to the conventional deadlift."

    "text": "Practical Recommendations\nBased on these findings:\n\nBuild your own velocity-RIR curve: Perform sets to failure at different loads while tracking velocity. Use this data to create your personalized equation.\nUse polynomial models: The curved relationship captures the data better than a straight line, especially as you approach failure.\nRecalibrate periodically: Your velocity-RIR relationship may shift with training adaptations.\nAccept some error: Even good individual models have ~1 rep error. Use velocity as a guide, not gospel."
