Does Training to Failure Matter?\n\n**[Pelland et al. (2024) Replication](01_pelland_meta_regression.qmd)**\n\nA meta-regression examining RIR and training outcomes across strength and hypertrophy studies.\n\n**Key Finding**: Training closer to failure benefits **hypertrophy** but not **strength**.\n\n| Outcome | RIR Effect | Significant? |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|\n| Strength | ~0 | No |\n| Hypertrophy | Negative | Yes |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Can Bar Speed Predict Effort?\n\n**[Paulsen et al. (2025) Replication](02_velocity_rir_relationship.qmd)**\n\nAnalysis of 2,972 observations examining velocity-RIR relationships.\n\n**Key Finding**: Velocity **moderately predicts** perceived effort (r ≈ 0.5), but varies substantially between individuals.\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Overall correlation | r = 0.45 |\n| Individual range | r = 0.09 to 0.79 |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Can We Model the RIR-Velocity Relationship?\n\n**[Jukic et al. (2024) Replication](03_rir_velocity_modeling.qmd)**\n\nAnalysis of 2,601 observations examining whether individual RIR-velocity models outperform general equations.\n\n**Key Finding**: Individual models explain **~2x more variance** than general models (R² = 0.88 vs 0.50).\n\n| Model Type | Median R² | Implication |\n|------------|-----------|-------------|\n| General | 0.50 | One-size-fits-all loses precision |\n| Individual | 0.88 | Personalization is essential |\n\n---\n\n### 4. Does This Work for Deadlifts?\n\n**[Deadlift RIR-Velocity Study](04_deadlift_rir_velocity.qmd)**\n\nOriginal thesis research applying the same methodology to **conventional deadlift** with 406 observations from 19 participants.\n\n**Key Finding**: The RIR-velocity relationship holds for deadlifts, but with **lower predictability** than squats.\n\n| Exercise | General R² | Individual R² | Improvement |\n|----------|-----------|--------------|-------------|\n| Squat (Study 3) | 0.50 | 0.88 | 1.8x |\n| Deadlift (Study 4) | 0.36 | 0.71 | 2x |\n\n**Why lower for deadlifts?** Binary failure patterns, grip fatigue, and lack of stretch-shortening cycle.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Practical Velocity Tables for Deadlift Training\n\n**[LMM Analysis & Velocity Stop Tables](05_deadlift_lmm_analysis.qmd)**\n\nLinear Mixed Effects analysis extending Study 4 with practical velocity thresholds for training.\n\n\n**Key Finding**: Load percentage does NOT significantly affect the velocity-RIR relationship. A **single global velocity table** is sufficient.\n\n| Table Type | MAE | Use Case |\n|------------|-----|----------|\n| General | 0.0599 m/s | Quick reference, new athletes |\n| Individual | 0.0395 m/s | Established athletes with calibration |\n\n**Improvement from individualization**: 34.0%\n\n\n---\n\n### 6. Advanced Velocity-RIR Analyses\n\n**[Advanced Velocity Analyses (H2-H6)](06_advanced_velocity_analyses.qmd)**\n\nFive novel analyses extending the deadlift velocity-RIR research with practical insights.\n\n\n| Analysis | Finding | Practical Implication |\n|----------|---------|----------------------|\n| MVT Variability | CV = 30.8% | Individual calibration essential |\n| Day-to-Day Reliability | Slope ICC = 0.72 | Periodic recalibration needed |\n| Model Comparison | 26.3% prefer quadratic | Linear model adequate |\n| Velocity Decay | Accelerates | Decay accelerates toward failure |\n| Failure Prediction | MAE = 1.29 reps | First rep velocity useful |\n\n\n---\n\n## Practical Implications\n\n### For Strength Training\n\nBased on the Pelland meta-regression:\n\n- **Stop 2-3 reps short** of failure on most sets\n- Failure training is not necessary for strength gains\n- This allows higher training frequency and volume\n\n### For Muscle Building\n\nBased on the Pelland meta-regression:\n\n- **Train closer to failure** (0-2 RIR) for optimal hypertrophy\n- The relationship is statistically significant but effect size is modest\n- Balance against recovery demands\n\n### For Velocity-Based Training\n\nBased on the Paulsen analysis:\n\n- **Individual calibration is essential** - Group averages don't work for everyone\n- **Exercise-specific targets** - Bench press and squat need different thresholds\n- **Use as complement** - Velocity + RPE together is better than either alone\n\n### For Deadlift Training\n\nBased on Study 4:\n\n- **VBT works, but with caveats** - Expect ~1.4 rep prediction error (vs ~1 rep for squat)\n- **Individual calibration still essential** - 2x improvement over general equations\n- **Load-specific thresholds** - Different velocity targets for 80% vs 90% 1RM\n- **Consider grip fatigue** - May affect velocity independently of target muscle fatigue\n\n## Data Sources\n\n| Study | Data | Code |\n|-------|------|------|\n| Pelland et al.
