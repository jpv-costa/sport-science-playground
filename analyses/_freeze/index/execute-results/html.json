(2024) Replication](01_pelland_meta_regression.qmd)**\n\nA meta-regression examining RIR and training outcomes across strength and hypertrophy studies.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Key Finding\nTraining closer to failure benefits **hypertrophy** but not **strength**.\n:::\n\n| Outcome | RIR Effect | Significant? |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|\n| Strength | ~0 | No |\n| Hypertrophy | Negative | Yes |\n\n---\n\n### Study 2: Can Bar Speed Predict Effort?\n\n**[Paulsen et al. (2025) Replication](02_velocity_rir_relationship.qmd)**\n\nAnalysis examining velocity-RIR relationships in squat and bench press.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Key Finding\nVelocity **moderately predicts** perceived effort (r ~ 0.5), but varies substantially between individuals.\n:::\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Overall correlation | r = 0.45 |\n| Individual range | r = 0.09 to 0.79 |\n\n---\n\n### Study 3: General vs Individual Models\n\n**[Jukic et al. (2024) Replication](03_rir_velocity_modeling.qmd)**\n\nAnalysis examining whether individual RIR-velocity models outperform general equations.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Key Finding\nIndividual models explain **~2x more variance** than general models (R-squared = 0.88 vs 0.50).\n:::\n\n| Model Type | Median R-squared | Implication |\n|------------|------------------|-------------|\n| General | 0.50 | One-size-fits-all loses precision |\n| Individual | 0.88 | Personalization is essential |\n\n---\n\n## Deadlift Study (MSc Thesis)\n\n**[Full Deadlift Study Report](deadlift_study.qmd)**\n\nThis comprehensive report presents original thesis research investigating the velocity-RIR relationship for the **conventional deadlift**. It combines:\n\n- **Exploratory analysis** of the deadlift velocity-RIR relationship\n- **Linear Mixed Effects Models** with nested random effects\n- **Practical velocity stop tables** for training prescription\n- **Advanced analyses** including reliability, model comparison, and failure prediction\n\n### Key Findings Summary\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(deadlift_results)) {\n  cat(\"| Metric | Deadlift | Squat (Reference) |\\n\")\n  cat(\"|--------|----------|-------------------|\\n\")\n  cat(sprintf(\"| General R-squared | %.2f | 0.50 |\\n\", deadlift_results$comparison$general_r2))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Individual R-squared | %.2f | 0.88 |\\n\", deadlift_results$comparison$individual_r2))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Improvement Factor | %.1fx | 1.8x |\\n\", deadlift_results$comparison$improvement_factor))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Participants | %d | 19 |\\n\", deadlift_results$summary$n_participants))\n} else {\n  cat(\"*Results will be available after running the analysis pipeline*\\n\")\n}\n```\n\n| Metric | Deadlift | Squat (Reference) |\n|--------|----------|-------------------|\n| General R-squared | 0.36 | 0.50 |\n| Individual R-squared | 0.71 | 0.88 |\n| Improvement Factor | 2.0x | 1.8x |\n| Participants | 19 | 19 |\n\n\n### Why Lower for Deadlifts?\n\nThe deadlift presents unique challenges for velocity-based training:\n\n1. **Binary failure** - Grip often fails suddenly rather than gradual velocity decline\n2. **No eccentric phase** - Each rep starts from a dead stop (no stretch-shortening cycle)\n3. **Grip fatigue** - May affect velocity independently of target muscle fatigue\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Key Findings\n\nBased on all studies in this compendium:\n\n| Question | Finding | Practical Implication |\n|----------|---------|----------------------|\n| Does VBT work for deadlifts? | Yes, but with more variability than squats | Use VBT as one tool, not the only tool |\n| Individual vs general models? | Individual models are ~2x more accurate | Calibrate individually for serious athletes |\n| Does load matter? | No significant effect (80% vs 90%) | One velocity table works across loads |\n| How often to recalibrate? | Moderate day-to-day reliability | Update every 2-4 weeks |\n| Can first rep predict set capacity? | Yes, with ~1-2 rep accuracy | Use for real-time autoregulation |\n\n---\n\n## Practical Implications\n\n### For Strength Training\n\nBased on the Pelland meta-regression:\n\n- **Stop 2-3 reps short** of failure on most sets\n- Failure training is not necessary for strength gains\n- This allows higher training frequency and volume\n\n### For Muscle Building\n\nBased on the Pelland meta-regression:\n\n- **Train closer to failure** (0-2 RIR) for optimal hypertrophy\n- The relationship is statistically significant but effect size is modest\n- Balance against recovery demands\n\n### For Velocity-Based Training\n\nBased on the Paulsen analysis:\n\n- **Individual calibration is essential** - Group averages don't work for everyone\n- **Exercise-specific targets** - Different exercises need different thresholds\n- **Use as complement** - Velocity + RPE together is better than either alone\n\n### For Deadlift Training\n\nBased on the thesis research:\n\n- **VBT works, but with caveats** - Expect ~1.4 rep prediction error (vs ~1 rep for squat)\n- **Individual calibration still essential** - 2x improvement over general equations\n- **Consider grip fatigue** - May affect velocity independently of target muscle fatigue\n\n---\n\n## Data Sources\n\n| Study | Data | Type |\n|-------|------|------|\n| Pelland et al.
