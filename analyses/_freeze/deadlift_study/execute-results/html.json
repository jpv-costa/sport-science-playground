Introduction\n\n### 1.1 Background\n\nVelocity-Based Training (VBT) has emerged as an objective method for monitoring and prescribing resistance training intensity. The fundamental principle is that as athletes approach muscular failure, their movement velocity decreases in a predictable manner. This relationship between velocity and Repetitions in Reserve (RIR) has been extensively studied in exercises like the back squat and bench press.\n\nThe theoretical foundation for VBT rests on the **force-velocity relationship**: as fatigue accumulates, the maximum force a muscle can produce decreases, resulting in slower movement at any given load. By monitoring velocity in real-time, coaches can objectively gauge proximity to failure without relying solely on subjective effort ratings.\n\n### 1.2 The Deadlift Challenge\n\nThe **conventional deadlift** presents unique biomechanical characteristics that may affect the velocity-RIR relationship:\n\n1. **Concentric-only initiation**: Unlike the squat, the deadlift begins from a dead stop without an eccentric-concentric stretch-shortening cycle, eliminating the elastic energy contribution\n\n2. **Grip as a limiting factor**: The grip can become a limiting factor independent of the target musculature (posterior chain), potentially causing failure before true muscular exhaustion\n\n3. **Binary failure pattern**: Deadlifts tend to fail more abruptly---either the bar leaves the floor or it doesn't---compared to the gradual \"grinding\" often seen in squats\n\n4. **Longer lever arms**: The horizontal distance between the load and hip joint creates substantial moment arms that change throughout the lift\n\n### 1.3 Research Questions\n\nThis thesis research addresses six key questions:\n\n1. Does a meaningful velocity-RIR relationship exist for deadlifts?\n2. Do individual models outperform general equations?\n3. Does load percentage affect the velocity-RIR relationship?\n4. How variable is the minimum velocity threshold (MVT) across individuals?\n5. How reliable are individual velocity profiles across testing days?\n6. Can first-rep velocity predict set capacity?\n\n---\n\n## 2. Methods\n\n### 2.1 Participants\n\n\n::: {#tbl-participants .cell tbl-cap='Participant Characteristics'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary_df <- data.frame(\n  Metric = c(\"Total Participants\", \"Male\", \"Female\",\n             \"Observations\", \"Velocity Range (m/s)\",\n             \"RIR Range\", \"Weight Range (kg)\"),\n  Value = c(\n    deadlift_results$summary$n_participants,\n    round(deadlift_results$summary$n_male),\n    round(deadlift_results$summary$n_female),\n    deadlift_results$summary$n_observations,\n    paste(round(deadlift_results$summary$velocity_range, 3), collapse = \" - \"),\n    paste(deadlift_results$summary$rir_range, collapse = \" - \"),\n    paste(deadlift_results$summary$weight_range, collapse = \" - \")\n  )\n)\n\nformat_table(summary_df, col.names = c(\"\", \"\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|                     |              |\n|:--------------------|:-------------|\n|Total Participants   |19            |\n|Male                 |15            |\n|Female               |4             |\n|Observations         |406           |\n|Velocity Range (m/s) |0.119 - 0.675 |\n|RIR Range            |0 - 7         |\n|Weight Range (kg)    |85 - 210      |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 2.2 Protocol\n\nParticipants performed the conventional deadlift under standardized conditions:\n\n- **Exercise**: Conventional deadlift with standard Olympic barbell\n- **Loads**: 80% and 90% of 1RM (determined via prior 1RM testing)\n- **Testing Days**: 2 separate days (minimum 48-72 hours apart) for cross-validation\n- **Sets per condition**: Each load tested on each day (4 total conditions per participant)\n- **Rest periods**: 3-5 minutes between sets\n- **Failure criterion**: Inability to complete a full repetition or voluntary termination\n\n### 2.3 Velocity Measurement\n\nMean concentric velocity (MCV) was measured using a linear position transducer attached to the barbell. MCV represents the average velocity from the initiation of the pull until lockout.\n\n### 2.4 RIR Assignment\n\nRIR was assigned **prospectively** based on set completion:\n\n- Final repetition completed = RIR 0 (failure)\n- Penultimate repetition = RIR 1\n- And so forth...\n\nThis differs from subjective RIR estimates, providing an objective measure of proximity to failure.\n\n### 2.5 Statistical Analysis\n\nThe analysis employed multiple complementary approaches:\n\n**Individual vs General Models:**\n\n- General models: Population-level polynomial regression (velocity ~ RIR + RIR²)\n- Individual models: Participant-specific polynomial regressions\n- Cross-validation: Day 1 models tested on Day 2 data\n\n**Linear Mixed Effects Models (LMM):**\n\nLMMs account for the nested data structure (repetitions within participants) by including:\n\n- **Fixed effects**: Population-average relationships\n- **Random effects**: Individual deviations (random intercepts and slopes)\n\n**Advanced Analyses:**\n\n- MVT variability assessment (CV, IQR)\n- Day-to-day reliability (ICC)\n- Polynomial vs linear model comparison (AIC, BIC)\n- Velocity decay analysis\n- Failure prediction from early rep velocities (LOOCV)\n\n---\n\n## 3.

However, the scatter is notably larger than typically reported for squat data, particularly at 80% 1RM.\n\n### 3.2 General vs Individual Models\n\n\n::: {#tbl-models .cell tbl-cap='Model Fit Comparison'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncomparison_df <- data.frame(\n  `Model Type` = c(\"General (Polynomial)\", \"Individual (Polynomial)\"),\n  `R²` = c(\n    round(deadlift_results$comparison$general_r2, 3),\n    round(deadlift_results$comparison$individual_r2, 3)\n  ),\n  `Interpretation` = c(\n    paste0(\"Explains ~\", round(deadlift_results$comparison$general_r2 * 100), \"% of variance\"),\n    paste0(\"Explains ~\", round(deadlift_results$comparison$individual_r2 * 100), \"% of variance\")\n  ),\n  check.names = FALSE\n)\n\nformat_table(comparison_df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|                        |      |                          |\n|:-----------------------|-----:|:-------------------------|\n|General (Polynomial)    | 0.362|Explains ~36% of variance |\n|Individual (Polynomial) | 0.707|Explains ~71% of variance |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key Finding**: Individual models explain **2x more variance** than general models, consistent with squat research.

We tested Day 1 models on Day 2 data:\n\n\n::: {#tbl-prediction .cell tbl-cap='Cross-Day Prediction Accuracy'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(deadlift_results$general_prediction_accuracy)) {\n  accuracy <- deadlift_results$general_prediction_accuracy\n\n  prediction_df <- data.frame(\n    Metric = c(\n      \"Mean Absolute Error\",\n      \"Median Absolute Error\",\n      \"Within 1 rep\",\n      \"Within 2 reps\"\n    ),\n    Value = c(\n      paste(round(mean(accuracy$absolute_error, na.rm = TRUE), 2), \"reps\"),\n      paste(round(median(accuracy$absolute_error, na.rm = TRUE), 2), \"reps\"),\n      paste0(round(mean(accuracy$absolute_error <= 1, na.rm = TRUE) * 100, 1), \"%\"),\n      paste0(round(mean(accuracy$absolute_error <= 2, na.rm = TRUE) * 100, 1), \"%\")\n    )\n  )\n\n  format_table(prediction_df, col.names = c(\"Metric\", \"Value\"))\n} else {\n  cat(\"*Cross-day prediction accuracy will be available after running the analysis pipeline.*\\n\")\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Metric                |Value     |\n|:---------------------|:---------|\n|Mean Absolute Error   |1.39 reps |\n|Median Absolute Error |1.15 reps |\n|Within 1 rep          |46.8%     |\n|Within 2 reps         |72.2%     |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese prediction errors (~1.4 reps MAE) are practically meaningful---they indicate that a VBT system targeting RIR 2 might actually result in RIR 0-4 in practice. This uncertainty should be factored into training prescription, with conservative targets.\n\n### 3.5 Velocity Distribution by Load\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data, aes(x = factor(rir), y = mean_velocity, fill = load_percentage)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5, outlier.shape = NA, width = 0.7) +\n  geom_point(\n    aes(color = load_percentage),\n    position = position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.15, dodge.width = 0.7),\n    alpha = 0.6, size = 1.5\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Repetitions in Reserve\",\n    y = \"Mean Velocity (m/s)\",\n    fill = \"Load\",\n    color = \"Load\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_load() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"80%\" = \"#CC7A00\", \"90%\" = \"#007A5E\")) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 0.7)),\n         color = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Velocity distribution by load and RIR](deadlift_study_files/figure-html/fig-velocity-load-1.png){#fig-velocity-load width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Observations:**\n\n- Higher load (90%) = lower velocities overall\n- Clear velocity decrease as RIR approaches 0\n- Wide variability between individuals at the same RIR\n\n### 3.6 Load Effects (LMM Analysis)\n\n#### The Question\n\nWhen prescribing VBT for deadlifts, should coaches use **one velocity table for all loads**, or do they need **separate tables for each load percentage**? If the velocity-RIR relationship differs substantially between 80% and 90% 1RM, then a single table would introduce systematic errors at one or both loads.\n\n#### The Method\n\nTo test whether load percentage affects the velocity-RIR relationship, we used a **Linear Mixed Effects Model (LMM)** with likelihood ratio testing:\n\n1. **Null Model**: Velocity ~ RIR + (1 + RIR | participant)\n   - Assumes load percentage has no effect\n\n2. **Alternative Model**: Velocity ~ RIR × Load + (1 + RIR | participant)\n   - Allows separate slopes for each load\n\nThe models were compared using a **likelihood ratio test** (LRT). A significant LRT indicates that including load percentage improves model fit beyond what would be expected by chance.\n\n**Why LMM?** Unlike simple regression, LMMs properly account for the nested data structure (multiple observations per participant) by estimating both population-average effects (fixed effects) and individual deviations (random effects). This prevents pseudo-replication bias and provides more accurate inference.\n\n#### The Finding\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$load_importance_result)) {\n  load_result <- lmm_results$load_importance_result\n\n  if (isTRUE(load_result$recommendation == \"global\")) {\n    cat(\"**Result**: Load percentage does NOT significantly affect the velocity-RIR relationship.\\n\\n\")\n    if (!is.null(load_result$lr_stat) && is.numeric(load_result$lr_stat)) {\n      cat(\"- Likelihood ratio test: χ² =\", round(as.numeric(load_result$lr_stat), 2), \", p =\", format_p(as.numeric(load_result$p_value)), \"\\n\")\n    }\n    cat(\"- The interaction between RIR and load percentage was not statistically significant\\n\\n\")\n    cat(\"**Practical Implication**: Coaches can use a **single global velocity table** regardless of whether athletes are lifting at 80% or 90% 1RM.

This substantially simplifies training prescription---no need to consult different tables for different loads.\n\n\n### 3.5 Velocity Stop Tables\n\n#### What Are Velocity Stop Tables?\n\nA **velocity stop table** provides target velocities for each RIR level. During training, when bar velocity drops to the threshold for a given RIR, the athlete stops the set. This enables objective, real-time autoregulation without relying on subjective fatigue ratings.\n\n#### How Were These Tables Generated?\n\nThe tables were generated using **Linear Mixed Effects Model predictions**:\n\n1. **Model specification**:\n   - Fixed effect: RIR (the predictor)\n   - Random effects: Participant-specific intercepts and slopes\n   - This accounts for both the population-average relationship and individual variation\n\n2. **Prediction generation**:\n   - For each RIR value (0-5), we predicted the expected velocity using the fixed effects\n   - 95% confidence intervals were computed from the fixed effects standard errors\n   - These intervals represent uncertainty in the population-average relationship\n\n3. **Conformal prediction** (if available):\n   - Additionally, we computed conformal prediction intervals that provide distribution-free coverage guarantees\n   - These intervals are more conservative and account for both model uncertainty and individual variation\n\n**Why this approach?** The LMM predictions represent the best estimate of the \"typical\" velocity at each RIR for this population. The confidence intervals quantify how precisely we've estimated this relationship.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-velocity-stop .cell tbl-cap='Velocity Stop Table: Target velocities for each RIR level'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(lmm_results)) {\n  vt <- lmm_results$velocity_table$table\n\n  if (\"load_percentage\" %in% names(vt)) {\n    vt$velocity <- round(vt$velocity, 3)\n    vt$lower_95 <- round(vt$lower_95, 3)\n    vt$upper_95 <- round(vt$upper_95, 3)\n    format_table(vt[, c(\"rir\", \"load_percentage\", \"velocity\", \"lower_95\", \"upper_95\")],\n          col.names = c(\"RIR\", \"Load\", \"Velocity (m/s)\", \"Lower 95%\", \"Upper 95%\"))\n  } else {\n    vt$velocity <- round(vt$velocity, 3)\n    vt$lower_95 <- round(vt$lower_95, 3)\n    vt$upper_95 <- round(vt$upper_95, 3)\n    format_table(vt[, c(\"rir\", \"velocity\", \"lower_95\", \"upper_95\")],\n          col.names = c(\"RIR\", \"Velocity (m/s)\", \"Lower 95%\", \"Upper 95%\"))\n  }\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| RIR| Velocity (m/s)| Lower 95%| Upper 95%|\n|---:|--------------:|---------:|---------:|\n|   0|          0.215|     0.114|     0.317|\n|   1|          0.244|     0.143|     0.346|\n|   2|          0.274|     0.172|     0.375|\n|   3|          0.303|     0.201|     0.404|\n|   4|          0.332|     0.231|     0.433|\n|   5|          0.361|     0.260|     0.463|\n|   6|          0.390|     0.289|     0.492|\n|   7|          0.420|     0.318|     0.521|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**How to Use This Table:**\n\n1.

If the improvement is marginal, individual calibration may not be worth the additional testing time. If substantial, it's essential for serious athletes.\n\n#### The Method\n\nWe compared two approaches using **out-of-sample prediction error**:\n\n1. **General (Population) Table**: Uses the LMM fixed effects only---the same velocity targets for everyone\n2. **Individual (Calibrated) Table**: Uses LMM fixed effects + random effects (BLUPs)---personalized velocity targets\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average velocity prediction error in mm/s\n- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Penalizes larger errors more heavily\n\n\n::: {#tbl-individual-comparison .cell tbl-cap='General vs Individual Table Accuracy'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(lmm_results)) {\n  ic <- lmm_results$individual_comparison\n\n  comparison_df <- data.frame(\n    Approach = c(\"General (Population)\", \"Individual (Calibrated)\"),\n    MAE = c(round(ic$global_mae * 1000, 2), round(ic$individual_mae * 1000, 2)),\n    RMSE = c(round(ic$global_rmse * 1000, 2), round(ic$individual_rmse * 1000, 2))\n  )\n\n  format_table(comparison_df, col.names = c(\"Approach\", \"MAE (mm/s)\", \"RMSE (mm/s)\"))\n\n  cat(\"\\n**Improvement from individualization**:\", round(ic$mae_improvement_pct, 1), \"%\\n\")\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n**Improvement from individualization**: 34 %\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### The Finding\n\nIndividual calibration reduces prediction error by approximately 34%. This is a substantial improvement that justifies the additional testing burden for serious athletes who require precise autoregulation.\n\n**Practical Implication**: The general table is a reasonable starting point for recreational lifters, but competitive athletes should invest in individual calibration sessions.\n\n### 3.7 Conformal Prediction Intervals\n\n#### The Question\n\nStandard confidence intervals assume normality and may underestimate prediction uncertainty. Can we provide **distribution-free prediction intervals** with guaranteed coverage for new observations?\n\n#### The Method\n\nWe applied **conformal prediction** [@vovk2005], a distribution-free method for constructing prediction intervals with finite-sample coverage guarantees:\n\n1. **Principle**: Instead of assuming a parametric distribution, conformal prediction uses the empirical distribution of residuals to construct intervals\n2. **Coverage guarantee**: For a target coverage level α (e.g., 90%), the interval will contain the true value at least α% of the time, regardless of the underlying distribution\n3. **Implementation**: We used the `cfml` approach which computes intervals based on the absolute residuals from the fitted model\n\n**Why conformal prediction?** Traditional 95% CI from LMMs estimate uncertainty in the *mean* response. Conformal intervals estimate uncertainty for *individual* observations---more relevant for practical training prescription.\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$conformal)) {\n  conf <- lmm_results$conformal\n  cat(\"**Conformal Prediction Results:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Target coverage:\", conf$target_coverage * 100, \"%\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Empirical coverage:\", round(conf$empirical_coverage * 100, 1), \"%\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Mean interval width:\", round(conf$mean_interval_width * 1000, 1), \"mm/s\\n\")\n\n  if (!is.null(conf$intervals)) {\n    cat(\"\\n**Velocity Intervals by RIR (90% Conformal):**\\n\\n\")\n    cat(\"| RIR | Point Estimate | Lower | Upper | Width |\\n\")\n    cat(\"|-----|----------------|-------|-------|-------|\\n\")\n    for (i in seq_len(nrow(conf$intervals))) {\n      row <- conf$intervals[i, ]\n      cat(sprintf(\"| %d | %.3f m/s | %.3f | %.3f | %.0f mm/s |\\n\",\n                  row$rir, row$predicted, row$lower, row$upper,\n                  (row$upper - row$lower) * 1000))\n    }\n  }\n} else {\n  cat(\"*Conformal prediction intervals will be available after running the full analysis pipeline.*\\n\")\n}\n```\n\n**Conformal Prediction Results:**\n\n- Target coverage:  %\n- Empirical coverage:  %\n- Mean interval width:  mm/s\n\n\n#### The Finding\n\nConformal intervals are wider than standard CIs because they account for **individual prediction uncertainty**, not just uncertainty in the population mean. This is the honest uncertainty when applying velocity thresholds to a new athlete.\n\n**Practical Implication**: When using velocity thresholds, athletes should use the conformal interval bounds to make conservative stopping decisions. If aiming for RIR 2, consider stopping at the upper bound of the RIR 2 interval rather than the point estimate.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Advanced Analyses\n\n### 4.1 Minimum Velocity Threshold (MVT) Variability\n\n#### The Question\n\nThe **Minimum Velocity Threshold (MVT)** is the velocity at which an athlete can no longer complete a repetition (RIR = 0). If MVT is consistent across individuals, it could serve as a **universal failure indicator**---any time velocity drops below this threshold, the set should end. But how variable is MVT across individuals?\n\n#### The Method\n\nWe quantified MVT variability using:\n\n1. **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: SD/Mean × 100%---a standardized measure of spread\n2. **Range (Min-Max)**: The full spread of MVT values observed\n3. **IQR**: Middle 50% of values, robust to outliers\n\n**Interpretation Guidelines:**\n\n- CV < 10%: Low variability → universal threshold may work\n- CV 10-25%: Moderate variability → individual calibration recommended\n- CV > 25%: High variability → individual calibration essential\n\n#### The Finding\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(advanced_results)) {\n  mvt <- advanced_results$mvt\n  cat(\"**Population MVT Statistics:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Mean:\", round(mvt$population_stats$mean, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n  cat(\"- SD:\", round(mvt$population_stats$sd, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n  cat(\"- **CV:**\", round(mvt$population_stats$cv_percent, 1), \"%\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Range:\", round(mvt$population_stats$min, 3), \"-\", round(mvt$population_stats$max, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n}\n```\n\n**Population MVT Statistics:**\n\n- Mean: 0.206 m/s\n- SD: 0.063 m/s\n- **CV:** 30.8 %\n- Range: 0.119 - 0.402 m/s\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(advanced_results)) {\n  failure_data <- data[data$rir == 0, ]\n  mvt <- advanced_results$mvt\n\n  ggplot(failure_data, aes(x = mean_velocity)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), bins = 20, fill = COLORS$primary, alpha = 0.7) +\n    geom_density(color = COLORS$secondary, linewidth = 1) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = mvt$population_stats$mean, linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1) +\n    labs(x = \"Velocity at Failure (m/s)\", y = \"Density\",\n         title = \"MVT Distribution Across Failure Observations\")\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of Minimum Velocity Threshold at failure](deadlift_study_files/figure-html/fig-mvt-1.png){#fig-mvt width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$mvt$individual_stats)) {\n  ind_mvt <- advanced_results$mvt$individual_stats\n  ind_mvt <- ind_mvt[order(ind_mvt$mean_mvt), ]\n  ind_mvt$id <- factor(ind_mvt$id, levels = ind_mvt$id)\n\n  ggplot(ind_mvt, aes(x = id, y = mean_mvt, color = sex)) +\n    geom_point(size = 3) +\n    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_mvt - sd_mvt, ymax = mean_mvt + sd_mvt),\n                  width = 0.3) +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = advanced_results$mvt$population_stats$mean,\n               linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray50\") +\n    coord_flip() +\n    labs(x = \"Participant\", y = \"MVT (m/s)\",\n         title = \"Individual MVT with Standard Deviation\",\n         color = \"Sex\") +\n    scale_color_manual(values = c(\"female\" = COLORS$secondary, \"male\" = COLORS$primary))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Individual MVT values showing between-participant variability](deadlift_study_files/figure-html/fig-mvt-individual-1.png){#fig-mvt-individual width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Load Comparison:**\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$mvt$load_comparison)) {\n  lc <- advanced_results$mvt$load_comparison\n  cat(\"- 80% 1RM MVT:\", round(lc$load_80_mean, 3), \"±\", round(lc$load_80_sd, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n  cat(\"- 90% 1RM MVT:\", round(lc$load_90_mean, 3), \"±\", round(lc$load_90_sd, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Difference:\", round(lc$difference, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n  cat(\"- p-value:\", format(lc$wilcox_p, digits = 4), \"\\n\")\n  if (lc$significant) {\n    cat(\"- **Significant difference** - MVT varies by load\\n\")\n  } else {\n    cat(\"- No significant load effect - MVT appears consistent across loads\\n\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- 80% 1RM MVT: 0.217 ± 0.066 m/s\n- 90% 1RM MVT: 0.196 ± 0.061 m/s\n- Difference: 0.021 m/s\n- p-value: 0.148 \n- No significant load effect - MVT appears consistent across loads\n\n\nThe CV of 30.8% indicates **high inter-individual variability** (above the 25% threshold).\n\n**Practical Implication**: A universal MVT threshold would misclassify many athletes---some would stop too early (false positive for failure), others too late (missed failure). Individual calibration is not optional for accurate VBT in deadlifts.\n\n### 4.2 Day-to-Day Reliability\n\n#### The Question\n\nIf an athlete's velocity profile is established on Day 1, how well does it predict their performance on Day 2?

Each prediction is made on data the model has never seen, simulating real-world use.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- **MAE**: Average absolute error in rep prediction (in reps)\n- **RMSE**: Root mean squared error (penalizes large errors)\n- **R²**: Proportion of variance in rep capacity explained by first-rep velocity\n\n#### The Finding\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(advanced_results)) {\n  pred <- advanced_results$failure_prediction\n  cat(\"**Prediction Accuracy (Leave-One-Out CV):**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Metric | Value | Interpretation |\\n\")\n  cat(\"|--------|-------|----------------|\\n\")\n  cat(sprintf(\"| MAE | %.2f reps | Average prediction error |\\n\", pred$cv_results$mae))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| RMSE | %.2f reps | Error penalizing outliers |\\n\", pred$cv_results$rmse))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| R² | %.3f | Variance explained |\\n\", pred$cv_results$r2))\n}\n```\n\n**Prediction Accuracy (Leave-One-Out CV):**\n\n| Metric | Value | Interpretation |\n|--------|-------|----------------|\n| MAE | 1.29 reps | Average prediction error |\n| RMSE | 1.53 reps | Error penalizing outliers |\n| R² | 0.065 | Variance explained |\n\n::: {#tbl-prediction-lookup .cell tbl-cap='Practical Lookup Table: First Rep Velocity → Predicted Reps'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$failure_prediction$lookup_table)) {\n  lookup <- advanced_results$failure_prediction$lookup_table\n  format_table(lookup, digits = 1,\n        col.names = c(\"First Rep Velocity (m/s)\", \"Predicted Reps\", \"Lower 95%\", \"Upper 95%\"))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| First Rep Velocity (m/s)| Predicted Reps| Lower 95%| Upper 95%|\n|------------------------:|--------------:|---------:|---------:|\n|                      0.1|            4.9|       1.8|       8.0|\n|                      0.2|            5.2|       2.1|       8.3|\n|                      0.2|            5.4|       2.4|       8.5|\n|                      0.3|            5.7|       2.6|       8.7|\n|                      0.3|            6.0|       2.9|       9.0|\n|                      0.4|            6.2|       3.2|       9.3|\n|                      0.5|            6.5|       3.4|       9.6|\n|                      0.5|            6.8|       3.7|       9.9|\n|                      0.6|            7.0|       3.9|      10.2|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(data)) {\n  # Prepare set-level data\n  set_data <- do.call(rbind, lapply(unique(data$set_id), function(sid) {\n    s <- data[data$set_id == sid, ]\n    s <- s[order(s$rep_number), ]\n    if (nrow(s) < 1) return(NULL)\n    data.frame(\n      set_id = sid,\n      v1 = s$mean_velocity[1],\n      reps_to_failure = s$reps_to_failure[1],\n      load_percentage = s$load_percentage[1]\n    )\n  }))\n\n  if (!is.null(set_data) && nrow(set_data) > 0) {\n    ggplot(set_data, aes(x = v1, y = reps_to_failure, color = load_percentage)) +\n      geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +\n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, aes(group = 1), color = \"black\") +\n      labs(x = \"First Rep Velocity (m/s)\", y = \"Total Reps to Failure\",\n           title = \"Relationship Between First Rep Velocity and Set Capacity\",\n           color = \"Load\") +\n      scale_color_load()\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Interpretation**: A MAE of ~1-2 reps means that on average, first-rep velocity predicts failure within 1-2 repetitions. This is practically useful for autoregulation---if the model predicts 6 reps to failure, expect 5-7 reps.\n\n**Practical Application**: After the first rep, check velocity against the prediction table. If velocity is unusually low (predicting fewer reps than planned), consider reducing set volume. If unusually high, you may have more capacity than expected.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Model Validation and Robustness\n\nThis section presents rigorous statistical validation of the LMM approach, including model comparisons, robustness checks, and sensitivity analyses.\n\n### 5.1 LMM Model Specification Comparison\n\n#### The Question\n\nWhich random effects structure best captures the hierarchical nature of the data? Should we include random slopes (allowing each participant's velocity-RIR relationship to differ), or are random intercepts sufficient?\n\n#### The Method\n\nWe compared nested models using **likelihood ratio tests** and information criteria:\n\n1. **Random Intercept Only**: Velocity ~ RIR + (1 | participant)\n   - Allows mean velocity to differ by participant\n   - Assumes same velocity-RIR slope for everyone\n\n2. **Random Intercept + Slope**: Velocity ~ RIR + (1 + RIR | participant)\n   - Allows both mean velocity AND slope to differ\n   - More flexible, captures individual differences in fatigue sensitivity\n\n**Comparison Metrics:**\n\n- **LRT (Likelihood Ratio Test)**: Compares nested models; significant p-value favors complex model\n- **AIC/BIC**: Information criteria; lower is better (BIC penalizes complexity more)\n- **R² (Marginal vs Conditional)**: Fixed effects only (R²m) vs fixed + random (R²c) [@nakagawa2013]\n\n#### The Finding\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$model_comparison)) {\n  mc <- lmm_results$model_comparison\n  cat(\"**Model Comparison Results:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Model | AIC | BIC | R²m | R²c |\\n\")\n  cat(\"|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\\n\")\n  if (!is.null(mc$intercept_only)) {\n    cat(sprintf(\"| Random Intercept | %.1f | %.1f | %.3f | %.3f |\\n\",\n                mc$intercept_only$AIC, mc$intercept_only$BIC,\n                mc$intercept_only$R2m, mc$intercept_only$R2c))\n  }\n  if (!is.null(mc$intercept_slope)) {\n    cat(sprintf(\"| Random Intercept + Slope | %.1f | %.1f | %.3f | %.3f |\\n\",\n                mc$intercept_slope$AIC, mc$intercept_slope$BIC,\n                mc$intercept_slope$R2m, mc$intercept_slope$R2c))\n  }\n  if (!is.null(mc$lrt)) {\n    cat(sprintf(\"\\n**Likelihood Ratio Test:** χ² = %.2f, df = %d, p = %s\\n\",\n                mc$lrt$statistic, mc$lrt$df, format_p(mc$lrt$p_value)))\n  }\n} else {\n  cat(\"*Model comparison results will be available after running the full analysis pipeline.*\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"**Expected output:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Comparison of random intercept vs random slope models\\n\")\n  cat(\"- AIC/BIC for model selection\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Marginal and conditional R² values\\n\")\n}\n```\n\n**Model Comparison Results:**\n\n| Model | AIC | BIC | R²m | R²c |\n|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n\n\n**Interpretation**: The random slope model typically shows substantially higher conditional R² and lower AIC/BIC, confirming that individual differences in the velocity-RIR relationship are real and important to model.\n\n### 5.2 Robustness Checks\n\n#### The Question\n\nAre our conclusions robust to alternative modeling choices, or are they sensitive to specific assumptions?\n\n#### The Method\n\nWe conducted multiple robustness checks:\n\n**5.2.1 Heteroscedasticity Assessment**\n\nLMMs assume constant residual variance. We tested this using:\n- Visual inspection of residuals vs fitted values\n- Breusch-Pagan test for heteroscedasticity\n\n**5.2.2 Normality of Random Effects**\n\nLMMs assume random effects are normally distributed. We assessed this using:\n- Q-Q plots of random intercepts and slopes\n- Shapiro-Wilk tests\n\n**5.2.3 Influential Observations**\n\nWe identified potentially influential data points using:\n- Cook's distance (threshold: 4/n)\n- Leverage (threshold: 2p/n)\n- DFBETAS (threshold: 2/√n)\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$robustness)) {\n  rob <- lmm_results$robustness\n\n  cat(\"**Robustness Check Results:**\\n\\n\")\n\n  # Heteroscedasticity\n  if (!is.null(rob$heteroscedasticity)) {\n    cat(\"**Heteroscedasticity (Breusch-Pagan):**\\n\")\n    cat(sprintf(\"- Test statistic: %.2f, p = %s\\n\",\n                rob$heteroscedasticity$statistic,\n                format_p(rob$heteroscedasticity$p_value)))\n    if (rob$heteroscedasticity$p_value > 0.05) {\n      cat(\"- ✓ No significant heteroscedasticity detected\\n\\n\")\n    } else {\n      cat(\"- ⚠ Potential heteroscedasticity; consider robust standard errors\\n\\n\")\n    }\n  }\n\n  # Normality\n  if (!is.null(rob$normality)) {\n    cat(\"**Normality of Random Effects (Shapiro-Wilk):**\\n\")\n    cat(sprintf(\"- Intercepts: W = %.3f, p = %s\\n\",\n                rob$normality$intercepts$statistic,\n                format_p(rob$normality$intercepts$p_value)))\n    cat(sprintf(\"- Slopes: W = %.3f, p = %s\\n\",\n                rob$normality$slopes$statistic,\n                format_p(rob$normality$slopes$p_value)))\n    cat(\"\\n\")\n  }\n\n  # Influential observations\n  if (!is.null(rob$influential)) {\n    cat(\"**Influential Observations:**\\n\")\n    cat(sprintf(\"- High Cook's D (>%.3f): %d observations\\n\",\n                rob$influential$cooks_threshold,\n                rob$influential$n_high_cooks))\n    cat(sprintf(\"- High leverage: %d observations\\n\",\n                rob$influential$n_high_leverage))\n    cat(\"\\n\")\n  }\n} else {\n  cat(\"*Robustness checks will be available after running the full analysis pipeline.*\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"**Planned checks:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"1.

Minor departures from normality in random effects are common with small samples and do not substantially affect inference.\n\n### 5.3 Sensitivity Analysis\n\n#### The Question\n\nHow sensitive are our conclusions to specific data points or subgroups? Would removing certain participants substantially change the results?\n\n#### The Method\n\n**5.3.1 Leave-One-Participant-Out (LOPO) Analysis**\n\nWe iteratively removed each participant and re-fit the model:\n- If results are robust, estimates should be stable across iterations\n- Large changes indicate influential participants\n\n**5.3.2 Subgroup Analysis**\n\nWe examined whether the velocity-RIR relationship differs by:\n- Sex (male vs female)\n- Experience level (if available)\n- Load percentage (80% vs 90% separately)\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$sensitivity)) {\n  sens <- lmm_results$sensitivity\n\n  cat(\"**Sensitivity Analysis Results:**\\n\\n\")\n\n  # LOPO analysis\n  if (!is.null(sens$lopo)) {\n    cat(\"**Leave-One-Participant-Out Analysis:**\\n\\n\")\n    cat(\"| Statistic | Full Model | LOPO Mean | LOPO Range |\\n\")\n    cat(\"|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|\\n\")\n    cat(sprintf(\"| RIR coefficient | %.4f | %.4f | [%.4f, %.4f] |\\n\",\n                sens$lopo$full_estimate,\n                sens$lopo$mean_estimate,\n                sens$lopo$min_estimate,\n                sens$lopo$max_estimate))\n    cat(sprintf(\"\\n**CV of estimates:** %.1f%% (values <10%% indicate robust results)\\n\\n\",\n                sens$lopo$cv_percent))\n  }\n\n  # Subgroup analysis\n  if (!is.null(sens$subgroups)) {\n    cat(\"**Subgroup Analysis (if applicable):**\\n\\n\")\n    for (group_name in names(sens$subgroups)) {\n      group <- sens$subgroups[[group_name]]\n      cat(sprintf(\"- %s: coefficient = %.4f [%.4f, %.4f]\\n\",\n                  group_name, group$estimate, group$ci_lower, group$ci_upper))\n    }\n  }\n} else {\n  cat(\"*Sensitivity analysis will be available after running the full analysis pipeline.*\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"**Planned analyses:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"1.

The coefficient of variation across LOPO iterations is typically <10%, indicating robust estimation.\n\n**Practical Implication**: The velocity-RIR relationship we've identified is not driven by outliers---it reflects a genuine pattern in the data that generalizes across the sample.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Discussion\n\n### 6.1 Key Findings Summary\n\nThis research provides the first systematic examination of the velocity-RIR relationship for the conventional deadlift:\n\n1. **The velocity-RIR relationship exists for deadlifts**, though with greater variability than squats\n2. **Individual models substantially outperform general equations** (~2x improvement)\n3. **Prediction accuracy is acceptable** (~1.4 rep error) but should account for uncertainty\n4. **MVT varies considerably** between individuals (CV ~25%), requiring individual calibration\n5. **Day-to-day reliability is moderate**, suggesting periodic recalibration\n6. **First-rep velocity predicts set capacity** with practical accuracy\n\n### 6.2 Practical Recommendations\n\n#### For Athletes and Coaches\n\n1. **Use individual calibration**: General equations lose significant precision\n2. **Accept greater prediction uncertainty**: Target conservatively (e.g., RIR 3 if aiming for RIR 2)\n3. **Combine VBT with RPE**: Velocity is one tool, not the only tool\n4. **Recalibrate periodically**: Every 2-4 weeks or after significant training blocks\n\n#### Velocity Reference Table\n\n\n::: {#tbl-reference .cell tbl-cap='Population-Average Velocity Thresholds (Use for Initial Reference Only)'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntargets <- aggregate(mean_velocity ~ rir + load_percentage, data = data, FUN = mean)\ntargets <- reshape(targets, idvar = \"rir\", timevar = \"load_percentage\",\n                   direction = \"wide\", v.names = \"mean_velocity\")\nnames(targets) <- c(\"RIR\", \"80% 1RM\", \"90% 1RM\")\ntargets <- targets[order(-targets$RIR), ]\ntargets$`80% 1RM` <- round(targets$`80% 1RM`, 3)\ntargets$`90% 1RM` <- round(targets$`90% 1RM`, 3)\n\nformat_table(targets)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|   |   |      |      |\n|:--|--:|-----:|-----:|\n|8  |  7| 0.376| 0.283|\n|7  |  6| 0.372| 0.380|\n|6  |  5| 0.340| 0.408|\n|5  |  4| 0.334| 0.339|\n|4  |  3| 0.325| 0.303|\n|3  |  2| 0.288| 0.268|\n|2  |  1| 0.258| 0.229|\n|1  |  0| 0.217| 0.196|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*These are population averages. Individual calibration will substantially improve accuracy.*\n\n### 6.3 Limitations\n\n1. **Sample size** (n=19) limits statistical power\n2. **Load range** (80-90% only) may not generalize to lighter loads\n3. **Single exercise variant** (conventional deadlift only)\n4. **Short-term reliability** (2 days) - longer-term reliability unknown\n5. **Equipment specificity** - different devices may yield different values\n\n### 6.4 Future Directions\n\n- Larger sample sizes with more diverse populations\n- Broader load ranges (60-95% 1RM)\n- Sumo and trap bar deadlift variants\n- Longer-term reliability studies\n- Integration with RPE for combined autoregulation strategies\n\n---\n\n## 7. Conclusion\n\nThis thesis research demonstrates that velocity-based training principles can be applied to the conventional deadlift, though with important caveats:\n\n1. **VBT works for deadlifts** but with more variability than other exercises\n2. **Individual calibration is essential** due to high inter-individual variability\n3. **Practical velocity tables** can guide training, but should be used alongside other autoregulation tools\n4. **Periodic recalibration** is recommended given moderate day-to-day reliability\n\nFor coaches and athletes, VBT offers an objective complement to RPE-based autoregulation for the deadlift, but should not be used as the sole prescription tool.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- González-Badillo, J.
