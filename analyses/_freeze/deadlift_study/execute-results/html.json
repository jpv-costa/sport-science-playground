The difference matters:\n\n| Approach | Question Asked | Goal |\n|----------|----------------|------|\n| Hypothesis Testing | \"Is the effect different from zero?\" | Reject or fail to reject H₀ |\n| **Model Building** | \"How well does this model describe the data?\" | Find the best description |\n\nWe build models to **understand and predict**---specifically, to create velocity-based training tools that work in practice. Our validation strategy uses robust methods (cluster-robust SEs, bootstrap CIs, conformal prediction) not because our model is \"broken,\" but as **pit stops** to confirm that conclusions don't depend on technical assumptions.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n| Question | Finding | Practical Implication |\n|----------|---------|----------------------|\n| **Does VBT work for deadlifts?** | Yes, but with more variability | Use VBT as one tool, not the only tool |\n| **Individual vs general models?** | Individual ~2x more accurate | Calibrate individually for serious athletes |\n| **Does load matter?** | No significant effect | One velocity table works across loads |\n| **MVT variability?** | CV = 30.8% | Individual calibration essential |\n| **Day-to-day reliability?** | Moderate (ICC ~0.5-0.7) | Recalibrate every 2-4 weeks |\n| **First-rep prediction?** | MAE = 1.29 reps | Useful for real-time autoregulation |\n\n### The Core Finding: Individual Variability\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Using OOP ModelPlotter class (CLAUDE.md principles)\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$best_model) &&\n    !is.null(lmm_results$best_model$model)) {\n\n  model_plotter$plot_model(\n    data = data,\n    model = lmm_results$best_model$model,\n    title = \"Why Individual Calibration Matters\"\n  )\n\n} else {\n  # Fallback to simple spaghetti if LMM not available\n  plot_spaghetti(\n    data,\n    highlight_population = TRUE,\n    title = \"Why Individual Calibration Matters\"\n  )\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Model Plot: Raw data (points) overlaid with individual fitted lines (gray) and the population-average model (red). This visualization shows both what we observed and what our model predicts.](deadlift_study_files/figure-html/fig-hero-model-plot-1.png){#fig-hero-model-plot width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis **model plot** shows our key insight: velocity decreases as athletes approach failure (the general trend in red), but **each athlete has a unique pattern** (gray lines). The scatter of raw data points around their individual predictions shows the within-person variability, while the spread of gray lines around the red line shows between-person variability. Using the population average (red) instead of individual calibration introduces substantial prediction error—this is why individual models are ~2x more accurate than general models.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\n### 1.1 Background\n\nVelocity-Based Training (VBT) has emerged as an objective method for monitoring and prescribing resistance training intensity. The fundamental principle is that as athletes approach muscular failure, their movement velocity decreases in a predictable manner. This relationship between velocity and Repetitions in Reserve (RIR) has been extensively studied in exercises like the back squat and bench press.\n\nThe theoretical foundation for VBT rests on the **force-velocity relationship**: as fatigue accumulates, the maximum force a muscle can produce decreases, resulting in slower movement at any given load. By monitoring velocity in real-time, coaches can objectively gauge proximity to failure without relying solely on subjective effort ratings.\n\n### 1.2 The Deadlift Challenge\n\nThe **conventional deadlift** presents unique biomechanical characteristics that may affect the velocity-RIR relationship:\n\n1. **Concentric-only initiation**: Unlike the squat, the deadlift begins from a dead stop without an eccentric-concentric stretch-shortening cycle, eliminating the elastic energy contribution\n\n2. **Grip as a limiting factor**: The grip can become a limiting factor independent of the target musculature (posterior chain), potentially causing failure before true muscular exhaustion\n\n3. **Binary failure pattern**: Deadlifts tend to fail more abruptly---either the bar leaves the floor or it doesn't---compared to the gradual \"grinding\" often seen in squats\n\n4. **Longer lever arms**: The horizontal distance between the load and hip joint creates substantial moment arms that change throughout the lift\n\n### 1.3 Research Questions\n\nThis thesis research addresses six key questions:\n\n1. Does a meaningful velocity-RIR relationship exist for deadlifts?\n2. Do individual models outperform general equations?\n3. Does load percentage affect the velocity-RIR relationship?\n4. How variable is the minimum velocity threshold (MVT) across individuals?\n5. How reliable are individual velocity profiles across testing days?\n6. Can first-rep velocity predict set capacity?\n\n---\n\n## 2.

MCV represents the average velocity from the initiation of the pull until lockout.\n\n### 2.4 RIR Assignment\n\nRIR was assigned **prospectively** based on set completion:\n\n- Final repetition completed = RIR 0 (failure)\n- Penultimate repetition = RIR 1\n- And so forth...\n\nThis differs from subjective RIR estimates, providing an objective measure of proximity to failure.\n\n### 2.5 Statistical Analysis\n\nThe analysis employed multiple complementary approaches:\n\n**Individual vs General Models:**\n\n- General models: Population-level polynomial regression (velocity ~ RIR + RIR²)\n- Individual models: Participant-specific polynomial regressions\n- Cross-validation: Day 1 models tested on Day 2 data\n\n#### Why Mixed Models? The Non-Independence Problem\n\nStandard regression assumes each observation is independent---knowing one data point tells you nothing about another. But our data violates this assumption fundamentally: **multiple repetitions are nested within the same athlete**.\n\nConsider why this matters:\n\n1. **Athlete A** might be naturally slower across all RIR levels (lower intercept)\n2. **Athlete B** might show steeper velocity decline as they fatigue (steeper slope)\n3. **Observations from the same athlete are correlated**---if Athlete A's first rep is slow, their second rep will likely also be slow\n\nIgnoring this clustering leads to two problems:\n\n- **Inflated sample size**: We have 406 observations but only 19 independent units (athletes)\n- **Pseudoreplication**: Standard errors become artificially small, producing spuriously significant p-values\n\n**The Design Effect** quantifies this inflation. With an intraclass correlation (ICC) of ρ and cluster size n, the effective sample size is reduced by:\n\n$$\\text{Design Effect} = 1 + (n - 1) \\times \\rho$$\n\nFor example, if ICC = 0.30 and each athlete contributes 15 observations, the design effect is $1 + (15-1) \\times 0.30 = 5.2$. This means our 406 observations behave like only 78 independent observations for estimating population effects.\n\n**Linear Mixed Effects Models (LMM)** solve this problem by explicitly modeling both:\n\n- **Fixed effects**: The population-average velocity-RIR relationship (what we want to estimate)\n- **Random effects**: Individual deviations from the population average (what creates the non-independence)\n\nThis approach provides correct standard errors, proper inference, and the ability to make both population-level and individual-level predictions.\n\n**Advanced Analyses:**\n\n- MVT variability assessment (CV, IQR)\n- Day-to-day reliability (ICC)\n- Polynomial vs linear model comparison (AIC, BIC)\n- Velocity decay analysis\n- Failure prediction from early rep velocities (LOOCV)\n\n---\n\n## 3.

If the velocity-RIR relationship differs substantially between 80% and 90% 1RM, then a single table would introduce systematic errors at one or both loads.\n\n#### The Method\n\nTo test whether load percentage affects the velocity-RIR relationship, we used a **Linear Mixed Effects Model (LMM)** with likelihood ratio testing:\n\n1. **Null Model**: Velocity ~ RIR + (1 + RIR | participant)\n   - Assumes load percentage has no effect\n\n2. **Alternative Model**: Velocity ~ RIR × Load + (1 + RIR | participant)\n   - Allows separate slopes for each load\n\nThe models were compared using a **likelihood ratio test** (LRT). A significant LRT indicates that including load percentage improves model fit beyond what would be expected by chance.\n\n**Why LMM?** Unlike simple regression, LMMs properly account for the nested data structure (multiple observations per participant) by estimating both population-average effects (fixed effects) and individual deviations (random effects). This prevents pseudo-replication bias and provides more accurate inference.\n\n#### The Finding\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$load_importance_result)) {\n  load_result <- lmm_results$load_importance_result\n\n  if (isTRUE(load_result$recommendation == \"global\")) {\n    cat(\"**Result**: Load percentage does NOT significantly affect the velocity-RIR relationship.\\n\\n\")\n    if (!is.null(load_result$lr_stat) && is.numeric(load_result$lr_stat)) {\n      cat(\"- Likelihood ratio test: χ² =\", round(as.numeric(load_result$lr_stat), 2), \", p =\", format_p(as.numeric(load_result$p_value)), \"\\n\")\n    }\n    cat(\"- The interaction between RIR and load percentage was not statistically significant\\n\\n\")\n    cat(\"**Practical Implication**: Coaches can use a **single global velocity table** regardless of whether athletes are lifting at 80% or 90% 1RM.

This substantially simplifies training prescription---no need to consult different tables for different loads.\n\n\n### 3.5 Velocity Stop Tables\n\n#### What Are Velocity Stop Tables?\n\nA **velocity stop table** provides target velocities for each RIR level. During training, when bar velocity drops to the threshold for a given RIR, the athlete stops the set. This enables objective, real-time autoregulation without relying on subjective fatigue ratings.\n\n#### How Were These Tables Generated?\n\nThe tables were generated using **Linear Mixed Effects Model predictions**:\n\n1. **Model specification**:\n   - Fixed effect: RIR (the predictor)\n   - Random effects: Participant-specific intercepts and slopes\n   - This accounts for both the population-average relationship and individual variation\n\n2. **Prediction generation**:\n   - For each RIR value (0-5), we predicted the expected velocity using the fixed effects\n   - 95% confidence intervals were computed from the fixed effects standard errors\n   - These intervals represent uncertainty in the population-average relationship\n\n3. **Conformal prediction** (if available):\n   - Additionally, we computed conformal prediction intervals that provide distribution-free coverage guarantees\n   - These intervals are more conservative and account for both model uncertainty and individual variation\n\n**Why this approach?** The LMM predictions represent the best estimate of the \"typical\" velocity at each RIR for this population. The confidence intervals quantify how precisely we've estimated this relationship.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-velocity-stop .cell tbl-cap='Velocity Stop Table: Target velocities for each RIR level'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(lmm_results)) {\n  vt <- lmm_results$velocity_table$table\n\n  if (\"load_percentage\" %in% names(vt)) {\n    vt$velocity <- round(vt$velocity, 3)\n    vt$lower_95 <- round(vt$lower_95, 3)\n    vt$upper_95 <- round(vt$upper_95, 3)\n    format_table(vt[, c(\"rir\", \"load_percentage\", \"velocity\", \"lower_95\", \"upper_95\")],\n          col.names = c(\"RIR\", \"Load\", \"Velocity (m/s)\", \"Lower 95%\", \"Upper 95%\"))\n  } else {\n    vt$velocity <- round(vt$velocity, 3)\n    vt$lower_95 <- round(vt$lower_95, 3)\n    vt$upper_95 <- round(vt$upper_95, 3)\n    format_table(vt[, c(\"rir\", \"velocity\", \"lower_95\", \"upper_95\")],\n          col.names = c(\"RIR\", \"Velocity (m/s)\", \"Lower 95%\", \"Upper 95%\"))\n  }\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| RIR| Velocity (m/s)| Lower 95%| Upper 95%|\n|---:|--------------:|---------:|---------:|\n|   0|          0.215|     0.114|     0.317|\n|   1|          0.244|     0.143|     0.346|\n|   2|          0.274|     0.172|     0.375|\n|   3|          0.303|     0.201|     0.404|\n|   4|          0.332|     0.231|     0.433|\n|   5|          0.361|     0.260|     0.463|\n|   6|          0.390|     0.289|     0.492|\n|   7|          0.420|     0.318|     0.521|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**How to Use This Table:**\n\n1.

If substantial, it's essential for serious athletes.\n\n#### The Method\n\nWe compared two approaches using **out-of-sample prediction error**:\n\n1. **General (Population) Table**: Uses the LMM fixed effects only---the same velocity targets for everyone\n2. **Individual (Calibrated) Table**: Uses LMM fixed effects + random effects (BLUPs)---personalized velocity targets\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average velocity prediction error in mm/s\n- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Penalizes larger errors more heavily\n\n\n::: {#tbl-individual-comparison .cell tbl-cap='General vs Individual Table Accuracy'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(lmm_results)) {\n  ic <- lmm_results$individual_comparison\n\n  comparison_df <- data.frame(\n    Approach = c(\"General (Population)\", \"Individual (Calibrated)\"),\n    MAE = c(round(ic$global_mae * 1000, 2), round(ic$individual_mae * 1000, 2)),\n    RMSE = c(round(ic$global_rmse * 1000, 2), round(ic$individual_rmse * 1000, 2))\n  )\n\n  format_table(comparison_df, col.names = c(\"Approach\", \"MAE (mm/s)\", \"RMSE (mm/s)\"))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Approach                | MAE (mm/s)| RMSE (mm/s)|\n|:-----------------------|----------:|-----------:|\n|General (Population)    |      59.86|       79.17|\n|Individual (Calibrated) |      39.54|       51.75|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(lmm_results)) {\n  ic <- lmm_results$individual_comparison\n  cat(\"\\n**Improvement from individualization**:\", round(ic$mae_improvement_pct, 1), \"%\\n\")\n}\n```\n\n\n**Improvement from individualization**: 34 %\n\n\n#### The Finding\n\nIndividual calibration reduces prediction error by approximately 34%.

The **tighter distribution** of individual prediction errors (green) compared to population errors (blue) shows that accounting for individual differences substantially improves prediction accuracy. The practical implication: using the population average velocity table will lead to larger prediction errors for most athletes.\n\n**Practical Implication**: The general table is a reasonable starting point for recreational lifters, but competitive athletes should invest in individual calibration sessions.\n\n### 3.7 Conformal Prediction Intervals\n\n#### The Problem with Parametric Intervals\n\nTraditional prediction intervals assume the residuals are normally distributed and homoscedastic (constant variance). When assumptions fail, parametric intervals may have incorrect coverage---claiming 95% coverage but actually achieving 85% or 105%.\n\n#### The Conformal Prediction Solution\n\n**Conformal prediction** [@vovk2005; @lei2018] provides **distribution-free** intervals with guaranteed finite-sample coverage. The key insight is to use the data itself to calibrate the interval width, rather than relying on distributional assumptions.\n\n#### Method: Split Conformal Prediction\n\nWe use **split conformal prediction**:\n\n1. **Split data**: Day 1 (calibration), Day 2 (test)\n2. **Fit model** on calibration set\n3. **Calculate nonconformity scores**: Absolute residuals on calibration set\n4. **Find threshold**: The 95th percentile of nonconformity scores\n5. **Construct intervals**: For new predictions, add/subtract the threshold\n\nThis procedure guarantees that if calibration and test data are exchangeable, coverage will be at least 95% in expectation.\n\n#### Conformal vs Parametric Comparison\n\n\n::: {#tbl-conformal .cell tbl-cap='Conformal vs Parametric Prediction Intervals'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$conformal)) {\n  conf <- lmm_results$conformal\n\n  comparison_df <- data.frame(\n    Metric = c(\"Target Coverage\", \"Empirical Coverage\", \"Average Interval Width\"),\n    Parametric = c(\n      \"95%\",\n      sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", conf$comparison$parametric_coverage * 100),\n      sprintf(\"%.4f m/s\", conf$comparison$parametric_width)\n    ),\n    Conformal = c(\n      \"95%\",\n      sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", conf$comparison$conformal_coverage * 100),\n      sprintf(\"%.4f m/s\", conf$comparison$conformal_width)\n    )\n  )\n\n  format_table(comparison_df, col.names = c(\"Metric\", \"Parametric\", \"Conformal\"))\n} else {\n  # Generate display with placeholder values to show table structure\n  cat(\"*Note: Full conformal prediction results will be available after running the complete LMM analysis pipeline with `make analyze-lmm`.*\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"**Expected output:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Metric | Parametric | Conformal |\\n\")\n  cat(\"|--------|------------|----------|\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Target Coverage | 95% | 95% |\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Empirical Coverage | ~92-96% | ~94-96% |\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Average Interval Width | ~0.08-0.12 m/s | ~0.10-0.14 m/s |\\n\")\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Metric                 |Parametric |Conformal |\n|:----------------------|:----------|:---------|\n|Target Coverage        |95%        |95%       |\n|Empirical Coverage     |95%        |95%       |\n|Average Interval Width |95%        |95%       |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$conformal)) {\n  conf <- lmm_results$conformal\n  # Use correct field names: pi_coverage for parametric, coverage for conformal\n  parametric_cov <- conf$comparison$pi_coverage\n  conformal_cov <- conf$coverage\n\n  cat(\"\\n**Key Insight:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Parametric (PI) coverage:\", sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", parametric_cov * 100),\n      \"(deviation from 95%:\", sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", abs(parametric_cov -

But how variable is MVT across individuals?\n\n#### The Method\n\nWe quantified MVT variability using:\n\n1. **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: SD/Mean × 100%---a standardized measure of spread\n2. **Range (Min-Max)**: The full spread of MVT values observed\n3. **IQR**: Middle 50% of values, robust to outliers\n\n**Interpretation Guidelines:**\n\n- CV < 10%: Low variability → universal threshold may work\n- CV 10-25%: Moderate variability → individual calibration recommended\n- CV > 25%: High variability → individual calibration essential\n\n#### The Finding\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(advanced_results)) {\n  mvt <- advanced_results$mvt\n  cat(\"**Population MVT Statistics:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Mean:\", round(mvt$population_stats$mean, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n  cat(\"- SD:\", round(mvt$population_stats$sd, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n  cat(\"- **CV:**\", round(mvt$population_stats$cv_percent, 1), \"%\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Range:\", round(mvt$population_stats$min, 3), \"-\", round(mvt$population_stats$max, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n}\n```\n\n**Population MVT Statistics:**\n\n- Mean: 0.206 m/s\n- SD: 0.063 m/s\n- **CV:** 30.8 %\n- Range: 0.119 - 0.402 m/s\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(advanced_results)) {\n  failure_data <- data[data$rir == 0, ]\n  mvt <- advanced_results$mvt\n\n  ggplot(failure_data, aes(x = mean_velocity)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), bins = 20, fill = COLORS$primary, alpha = 0.7) +\n    geom_density(color = COLORS$secondary, linewidth = 1) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = mvt$population_stats$mean, linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1) +\n    labs(x = \"Velocity at Failure (m/s)\", y = \"Density\",\n         title = \"MVT Distribution Across Failure Observations\")\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of Minimum Velocity Threshold at failure](deadlift_study_files/figure-html/fig-mvt-1.png){#fig-mvt width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$mvt$individual_stats)) {\n  ind_mvt <- advanced_results$mvt$individual_stats\n  ind_mvt <- ind_mvt[order(ind_mvt$mean_mvt), ]\n  ind_mvt$id <- factor(ind_mvt$id, levels = ind_mvt$id)\n\n  ggplot(ind_mvt, aes(x = id, y = mean_mvt, color = sex)) +\n    geom_point(size = 3) +\n    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_mvt - sd_mvt, ymax = mean_mvt + sd_mvt),\n                  width = 0.3) +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = advanced_results$mvt$population_stats$mean,\n               linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray50\") +\n    coord_flip() +\n    labs(x = \"Participant\", y = \"MVT (m/s)\",\n         title = \"Individual MVT with Standard Deviation\",\n         color = \"Sex\") +\n    scale_color_manual(values = c(\"female\" = COLORS$secondary, \"male\" = COLORS$primary))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Individual MVT values showing between-participant variability](deadlift_study_files/figure-html/fig-mvt-individual-1.png){#fig-mvt-individual width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Load Comparison:**\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$mvt$load_comparison)) {\n  lc <- advanced_results$mvt$load_comparison\n  cat(\"- 80% 1RM MVT:\", round(lc$load_80_mean, 3), \"±\", round(lc$load_80_sd, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n  cat(\"- 90% 1RM MVT:\", round(lc$load_90_mean, 3), \"±\", round(lc$load_90_sd, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n  cat(\"- Difference:\", round(lc$difference, 3), \"m/s\\n\")\n  cat(\"- p-value:\", format(lc$wilcox_p, digits = 4), \"\\n\")\n  if (lc$significant) {\n    cat(\"- **Significant difference** - MVT varies by load\\n\")\n  } else {\n    cat(\"- No significant load effect - MVT appears consistent across loads\\n\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- 80% 1RM MVT: 0.217 ± 0.066 m/s\n- 90% 1RM MVT: 0.196 ± 0.061 m/s\n- Difference: 0.021 m/s\n- p-value: 0.148 \n- No significant load effect - MVT appears consistent across loads\n\n\nThe CV of 30.8% indicates **high inter-individual variability** (above the 25% threshold).\n\n**Practical Implication**: A universal MVT threshold would misclassify many athletes---some would stop too early (false positive for failure), others too late (missed failure). Individual calibration is not optional for accurate VBT in deadlifts.\n\n### 4.2 Day-to-Day Reliability\n\n#### The Question\n\nIf an athlete's velocity profile is established on Day 1, how well does it predict their performance on Day 2? Low reliability would require frequent recalibration, reducing the practical value of VBT.\n\n#### The Method\n\nWe assessed reliability using the **Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)** [@shroutfleiss1979; @kooli2016]:\n\n1. **ICC(2,1)**: Two-way random effects model, single measurement---the standard for test-retest reliability\n2. **Parameters assessed**:\n   - Velocity-RIR slope (sensitivity of velocity to fatigue)\n   - MVT (velocity at failure)\n\n**Interpretation Guidelines** [@kooli2016]:\n\n- ICC < 0.50: Poor reliability\n- ICC 0.50-0.75: Moderate reliability\n- ICC 0.75-0.90: Good reliability\n- ICC > 0.90: Excellent reliability\n\n**Additional Metrics:**\n\n- **SEM (Standard Error of Measurement)**: Expected test-retest variability in same units as measurement\n- **MDC95 (Minimal Detectable Change)**: The smallest change that exceeds measurement error with 95% confidence\n\n#### The Finding\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif

Question\n\nThe velocity-RIR relationship could be linear (constant velocity loss per rep) or curvilinear (accelerating velocity loss near failure). Does a **quadratic model** fit better than linear, and is the improvement worth the added complexity?\n\n#### The Method\n\nFor each participant, we fit both models and compared them:\n\n1. **Linear**: Velocity = β₀ + β₁ × RIR\n2. **Quadratic**: Velocity = β₀ + β₁ × RIR + β₂ × RIR²\n\n**Model Selection Criteria:**\n\n- **AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)**: Balances fit against complexity; lower is better\n- **R² improvement**: How much additional variance is explained by the quadratic term\n\n**Decision Rule:** Quadratic is \"better\" if AIC is lower by ≥2 points (meaningful improvement) AND R² improves by ≥0.01.\n\n#### The Finding\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(advanced_results)) {\n  poly <- advanced_results$polynomial_comparison\n  cat(\"**Model Comparison Results:**\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\"| Metric | Value |\\n\")\n  cat(\"|--------|-------|\\n\")\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Participants analyzed | %d |\\n\", poly$best_model_summary$n_participants))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Linear model preferred | %d (%.0f%%) |\\n\",\n              poly$best_model_summary$n_linear_best,\n              100 - poly$best_model_summary$pct_quad_best))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Quadratic model preferred | %d (%.0f%%) |\\n\",\n              poly$best_model_summary$n_quad_best,\n              poly$best_model_summary$pct_quad_best))\n  cat(sprintf(\"| Average R² improvement (quadratic) | %.4f |\\n\", poly$best_model_summary$avg_r2_improvement))\n}\n```\n\n**Model Comparison Results:**\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Participants analyzed | 19 |\n| Linear model preferred | 14 (74%) |\n| Quadratic model preferred | 5 (26%) |\n| Average R² improvement (quadratic) | 0.0164 |\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$polynomial_comparison$individual_results)) {\n  ind_results <- advanced_results$polynomial_comparison$individual_results\n\n  ggplot(ind_results, aes(x = reorder(id, delta_aic), y = delta_aic, fill = best_model)) +\n    geom_col() +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = -2, linetype = \"dashed\", color = COLORS$secondary) +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 2, linetype = \"dashed\", color = COLORS$secondary) +\n    coord_flip() +\n    labs(x = \"Participant\", y = \"ΔAIC (Quadratic - Linear)\",\n         title = \"Model Comparison by Participant\",\n         subtitle = \"Negative values favor quadratic model\",\n         fill = \"Best Model\") +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"linear\" = COLORS$primary, \"quadratic\" = COLORS$tertiary))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![AIC comparison between linear and quadratic models by participant](deadlift_study_files/figure-html/fig-model-aic-1.png){#fig-model-aic width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Interpretation**: For the majority of participants, the **linear model is sufficient**. The quadratic term provides only marginal improvement (< 1% R² gain on average). This simplifies practical application---coaches can use a simple linear relationship without sacrificing meaningful accuracy.\n\n**Practical Implication**: Use linear velocity tables. The small theoretical improvement from polynomial models is not worth the added complexity for training prescription.\n\n### 4.4 Velocity Decay Patterns\n\n#### The Question\n\nDoes velocity loss occur at a **constant rate** throughout a set, or does it **accelerate** as failure approaches?

Model Validation and Robustness\n\nThis section presents rigorous statistical validation of the LMM approach, including model comparisons, robustness checks, and sensitivity analyses.\n\n### 5.1 LMM Model Specification Comparison\n\n#### The Question\n\nWhich random effects structure best captures the hierarchical nature of the data? Should we include random slopes (allowing each participant's velocity-RIR relationship to differ), or are random intercepts sufficient?\n\n#### The Method\n\nWe compared nested models using **likelihood ratio tests** and information criteria:\n\n1. **Random Intercept Only**: Velocity ~ RIR + (1 | participant)\n   - Allows mean velocity to differ by participant\n   - Assumes same velocity-RIR slope for everyone\n\n2. **Random Intercept + Slope**: Velocity ~ RIR + (1 + RIR | participant)\n   - Allows both mean velocity AND slope to differ\n   - More flexible, captures individual differences in fatigue sensitivity\n\n**Comparison Metrics:**\n\n- **LRT (Likelihood Ratio Test)**: Compares nested models; significant p-value favors complex model\n- **AIC/BIC**: Information criteria; lower is better (BIC penalizes complexity more)\n- **R² (Marginal vs Conditional)**: Fixed effects only (R²m) vs fixed + random (R²c) [@nakagawa2013]\n\n#### Why Random Slopes? A Three-Step Decision Framework\n\nBefore looking at formal comparisons, we should justify *why* random slopes are theoretically appropriate. This follows a principled three-step decision process:\n\n**Step 1: Do individuals differ in their baseline?**\n\nAthletes have different baseline velocities at any given RIR---some are inherently faster, others slower. This justifies **random intercepts**: each athlete gets their own starting point.\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(data)) {\n  # Calculate mean velocity per participant\n  participant_means <- aggregate(mean_velocity ~ id, data = data, FUN = mean)\n  velocity_range <- diff(range(participant_means$mean_velocity))\n\n  cat(sprintf(\"*Evidence:* Individual mean velocities range from %.3f to %.3f m/s (spread = %.3f m/s)\\n\",\n              min(participant_means$mean_velocity), max(participant_means$mean_velocity), velocity_range))\n}\n```\n\n*Evidence:* Individual mean velocities range from 0.227 to 0.418 m/s (spread = 0.191 m/s)\n\n\n**Step 2: Do individuals differ in their response to the predictor?**\n\nThe key question: does the velocity-RIR relationship vary across athletes? If some athletes show steep velocity decline while others show gradual decline, we need **random slopes**.\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(data)) {\n  # Calculate individual slopes\n  individual_slopes <- do.call(rbind, lapply(unique(data$id), function(pid) {\n    p_data <- data[data$id == pid, ]\n    if (nrow(p_data) >= 3) {\n      m <- lm(mean_velocity ~ rir, data = p_data)\n      data.frame(id = pid, slope = coef(m)[\"rir\"])\n    }\n  }))\n\n  if (nrow(individual_slopes) > 0) {\n    slope_range <- diff(range(individual_slopes$slope, na.rm = TRUE))\n    slope_cv <- sd(individual_slopes$slope, na.rm = TRUE) / abs(mean(individual_slopes$slope, na.rm = TRUE)) * 100\n\n    cat(sprintf(\"*Evidence:* Individual slopes range from %.4f to %.4f m/s per RIR (CV = %.1f%%)\\n\",\n                min(individual_slopes$slope, na.rm = TRUE),\n                max(individual_slopes$slope, na.rm = TRUE),\n                slope_cv))\n    cat(\"\\nThis substantial variation justifies random slopes.\\n\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\n*Evidence:* Individual slopes range from 0.0059 to 0.0668 m/s per RIR (CV = 51.5%)\n\nThis substantial variation justifies random slopes.\n\n\n**Step 3: Does the design support random slopes?**\n\nRandom slopes require multiple observations per participant at different predictor values. With 406/19 = ~21 observations per athlete across different RIR levels, we have sufficient data to estimate individual slopes reliably.\n\n**Decision:** All three conditions are met → **Random slopes are appropriate and necessary.**\n\n#### The Finding\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$model_comparison)) {\n  mc <- lmm_results$model_comparison\n\n  # Use comparison_table which contains all models\n  if (!is.null(mc$comparison_table)) {\n    ct <- mc$comparison_table\n\n    cat(\"**Model Comparison Results:**\\n\\n\")\n    cat(\"| Model | AIC | BIC | ΔAIC | R²m | R²c |\\n\")\n    cat(\"|-------|-----|-----|------|-----|-----|\\n\")\n\n    for (i in seq_len(nrow(ct))) {\n      cat(sprintf(\"| %s | %.1f | %.1f | %.1f | %.3f | %.3f |\\n\",\n                  ct$model[i], ct$AIC[i], ct$BIC[i], ct$delta_AIC[i],\n                  ct$R2_marginal[i], ct$R2_conditional[i]))\n    }\n\n    # Find best model\n    best_idx <- which.min(ct$AIC)\n    cat(sprintf(\"\\n**Best Model (lowest AIC):** %s\\n\", ct$model[best_idx]))\n  }\n} else {\n  cat(\"*Model comparison results will be available after running the full analysis pipeline.*\\n\\n\")\n}\n```\n\n**Model Comparison Results:**\n\n| Model | AIC | BIC | ΔAIC | R²m | R²c |\n|-------|-----|-----|------|-----|-----|\n| base | -1046.7 | -1030.7 | 62.6 | 0.339 | 0.616 |\n| random_slope | -1109.3 | -1085.2 | 0.0 | 0.435 | 0.639 |\n| with_load | -1101.1 | -1073.1 | 8.1 | 0.436 | 0.639 |\n| with_day | -1091.5 | -1059.4 | 17.8 | 0.438 | 0.639 |\n| interaction | -1105.6 | -1073.6 | 3.6 | 0.452 | 0.654 |\n| full | -1081.3 | -1037.2 | 28.0 | 0.458 | 0.658 |\n\n**Best Model (lowest AIC):** random_slope\n\n\n#### Bayes Factor Analysis: Quantifying the Evidence\n\nWhile AIC/BIC differences tell us which model fits better, they don't directly quantify *how much* evidence we have. **Bayes factors** provide an intuitive metric: how many times more likely is the data under one model versus another?\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$model_comparison) &&\n    !is.null(lmm_results$model_comparison$models)) {\n\n  models <- lmm_results$model_comparison$models\n\n  # Compare base vs random slope using ModelComparator\n  if (\"base\" %in% names(models) && \"random_slope\" %in% names(models)) {\n    comparison <- model_comparator$compare(\n      models$base, models$random_slope,\n      model1_name = \"Random Intercept Only\",\n      model2_name = \"Random Intercept + Slope\",\n      nested = TRUE\n    )\n\n    # Calculate Bayes factor from BIC\n    bic_diff <- BIC(models$base) - BIC(models$random_slope)\n    bf <- exp(bic_diff / 2)\n\n    cat(\"**Bayes Factor Analysis (Random Slope vs. Intercept-Only):**\\n\\n\")\n    cat(\"| Metric | Value | Interpretation |\\n\")\n    cat(\"|--------|-------|----------------|\\n\")\n    cat(sprintf(\"| BIC difference | %.1f | %s |\\n\", bic_diff,\n                ifelse(bic_diff > 0, \"Favors random slope\", \"Favors intercept-only\")))\n    cat(sprintf(\"| Bayes Factor | %.1f | %s |\\n\", bf,\n                model_comparator$interpret_bayes_factor(bf)))\n\n    if (!is.null(comparison$lrt_pvalue)) {\n      cat(sprintf(\"| LRT χ² | %.2f (df=%.0f) | p %s |\\n\",\n                  comparison$lrt_chisq, comparison$lrt_df,\n                  ifelse(comparison$lrt_pvalue < 0.001, \"< 0.001\",\n                         sprintf(\"= %.3f\", comparison$lrt_pvalue))))\n    }\n\n    cat(\"\\n**Interpretation Guide:**\\n\\n\")\n    cat(\"- **BF 1-3**: Weak/anecdotal evidence\\n\")\n    cat(\"- **BF 3-10**: Moderate evidence\\n\")\n    cat(\"- **BF 10-30**: Strong evidence\\n\")\n    cat(\"- **BF 30-100**: Very strong evidence\\n\")\n    cat(\"- **BF >100**: Decisive evidence\\n\\n\")\n\n    if (bf > 10) {\n      cat(sprintf(\"With BF = %.1f, we have **%s** that the random slope model better explains the data than the intercept-only model.

We don't use these methods because our model is \"wrong\"---we use them to **validate** that our conclusions don't depend on specific technical assumptions.\n\nThe key question isn't \"do my assumptions hold perfectly?\" (they never do). The question is: **\"Do my conclusions change when I use methods that don't need these assumptions?\"**\n\nIf the answer is \"no,\" then any assumption violations are academically interesting but practically irrelevant.\n\n**Our three validation pit stops:**\n\n| Pit Stop | What It Checks | If Standard & Robust Agree... |\n|----------|----------------|------------------------------|\n| Cluster-Robust SEs | Variance structure | Heteroscedasticity doesn't matter |\n| Bootstrap CIs | Distributional shape | Non-normality doesn't matter |\n| Sensitivity Analysis | Model specification | Specific choices don't matter |\n\n#### 5.3.1 Cluster-Robust Standard Errors\n\n**What This Tests:**\nStandard LMM standard errors assume that residual variance is constant across all observations (homoscedasticity). If this assumption is violated (e.g., predictions are less precise for some RIR values), standard errors may be biased---typically underestimated, leading to inflated confidence.\n\n**The Method:**\nThe **CR2 (bias-reduced) sandwich estimator** [@pustejovsky2018] provides standard errors that are valid regardless of the true variance structure.

This is because:\n\n1. **Formal tests are overpowered with large samples**---they detect trivial deviations that have no practical impact\n2. **Plots reveal the *nature* of violations**---is it a few outliers? A systematic pattern? Heavy tails?\n3. **\"Close enough\" is usually fine**---LMMs are robust to moderate assumption violations\n\nThe key question isn't \"does this p-value say normal?\" but rather: **\"Is the deviation severe enough to affect my conclusions?\"** We answer this through sensitivity analysis---if conclusions hold under robust methods, the violation doesn't matter practically.\n\n#### Visual Diagnostics\n\n**Start with plots, not tests.** Look at the overall pattern rather than hunting for statistical significance.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$diagnostics_full)) {\n  resids <- lmm_results$diagnostics_full$residuals\n\n  qqnorm(resids, main = \"Residual Q-Q Plot\", pch = 16, col = adjustcolor(COLORS$primary, 0.5))\n  qqline(resids, col = COLORS$secondary, lwd = 2)\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Q-Q Plot: Points should roughly follow the diagonal line.

Discussion\n\n### 6.1 Key Findings Summary\n\nThis research provides the first systematic examination of the velocity-RIR relationship for the conventional deadlift:\n\n1. **The velocity-RIR relationship exists for deadlifts**, though with greater variability than squats\n2. **Individual models substantially outperform general equations** (~2x improvement)\n3. **Prediction accuracy is acceptable** (~1.4 rep error) but should account for uncertainty\n4. **MVT varies considerably** between individuals (CV ~25%), requiring individual calibration\n5. **Day-to-day reliability is moderate**, suggesting periodic recalibration\n6. **First-rep velocity predicts set capacity** with practical accuracy\n\n### 6.2 Practical Recommendations\n\n#### For Athletes and Coaches\n\n1. **Use individual calibration**: General equations lose significant precision\n2. **Accept greater prediction uncertainty**: Target conservatively (e.g., RIR 3 if aiming for RIR 2)\n3. **Combine VBT with RPE**: Velocity is one tool, not the only tool\n4. **Recalibrate periodically**: Every 2-4 weeks or after significant training blocks\n\n#### Velocity Reference Table\n\n\n::: {#tbl-reference .cell tbl-cap='Population-Average Velocity Thresholds (Use for Initial Reference Only)'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntargets <- aggregate(mean_velocity ~ rir + load_percentage, data = data, FUN = mean)\ntargets <- reshape(targets, idvar = \"rir\", timevar = \"load_percentage\",\n                   direction = \"wide\", v.names = \"mean_velocity\")\nnames(targets) <- c(\"RIR\", \"80% 1RM\", \"90% 1RM\")\ntargets <- targets[order(-targets$RIR), ]\ntargets$`80% 1RM` <- round(targets$`80% 1RM`, 3)\ntargets$`90% 1RM` <- round(targets$`90% 1RM`, 3)\nrownames(targets) <- NULL\n\nformat_table(targets, col.names = c(\"RIR\", \"80% 1RM (m/s)\", \"90% 1RM (m/s)\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| RIR| 80% 1RM (m/s)| 90% 1RM (m/s)|\n|---:|-------------:|-------------:|\n|   7|         0.376|         0.283|\n|   6|         0.372|         0.380|\n|   5|         0.340|         0.408|\n|   4|         0.334|         0.339|\n|   3|         0.325|         0.303|\n|   2|         0.288|         0.268|\n|   1|         0.258|         0.229|\n|   0|         0.217|         0.196|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*These are population averages. Individual calibration will substantially improve accuracy.*\n\n### 6.3 Limitations\n\n1. **Sample size** (n=19) limits statistical power\n2. **Load range** (80-90% only) may not generalize to lighter loads\n3. **Single exercise variant** (conventional deadlift only)\n4. **Short-term reliability** (2 days) - longer-term reliability unknown\n5. **Equipment specificity** - different devices may yield different values\n\n### 6.4 Future Directions\n\n- Larger sample sizes with more diverse populations\n- Broader load ranges (60-95% 1RM)\n- Sumo and trap bar deadlift variants\n- Longer-term reliability studies\n- Integration with RPE for combined autoregulation strategies\n\n---\n\n## 7. Conclusion\n\nThis thesis research demonstrates that velocity-based training principles can be applied to the conventional deadlift, though with important caveats:\n\n1. **VBT works for deadlifts** but with more variability than other exercises\n2. **Individual calibration is essential** due to high inter-individual variability\n3. **Practical velocity tables** can guide training, but should be used alongside other autoregulation tools\n4. **Periodic recalibration** is recommended given moderate day-to-day reliability\n\nFor coaches and athletes, VBT offers an objective complement to RPE-based autoregulation for the deadlift, but should not be used as the sole prescription tool.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- González-Badillo, J.
