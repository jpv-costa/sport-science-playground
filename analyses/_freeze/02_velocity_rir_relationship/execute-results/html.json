Velocity-based training works best when calibrated to each lifter and each exercise.\n:::\n\n## Methods Summary\n\n### Data Collection\n\n- Trained participants performed squat and bench press\n- Mean velocity measured with validated device\n- Perceived RIR recorded after each set\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\n- Pearson correlations (overall and per-participant)\n- Linear mixed models accounting for repeated measures\n- Exercise-specific subgroup analysis\n\n## Source\n\n- Original paper: [Paulsen et al.
