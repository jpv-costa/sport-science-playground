## Executive Summary

This research investigates whether velocity-based training (VBT) principles, well-established for exercises like the squat and bench press, can be successfully applied to the **conventional deadlift**---an exercise with unique biomechanical characteristics.

### Our Analytical Approach

This analysis follows a **model-building** philosophy rather than traditional null hypothesis testing. The difference matters:

| Approach | Question Asked | Goal |
|----------|----------------|------|
| Hypothesis Testing | "Is the effect different from zero?" | Reject or fail to reject H₀ |
| **Model Building** | "How well does this model describe the data?" | Find the best description |

We build models to **understand and predict**---specifically, to create velocity-based training tools that work in practice. Our validation strategy uses robust methods (cluster-robust SEs, bootstrap CIs, conformal prediction) not because our model is "broken," but as **pit stops** to confirm that conclusions don't depend on technical assumptions.

### Key Findings

| Question | Finding | Practical Implication |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| **Does VBT work for deadlifts?** | Yes, but with more variability | Use VBT as one tool, not the only tool |
| **Individual vs general models?** | Individual ~`r round(deadlift_results$comparison$improvement_factor, 1)`x more accurate | Calibrate individually for serious athletes |
| **Does load matter?** | `r if(!is.null(lmm_results) && lmm_results$load_importance_result$recommendation == "global") "No significant effect" else "Significant effect"` | `r if(!is.null(lmm_results) && lmm_results$load_importance_result$recommendation == "global") "One velocity table works across loads" else "Use load-specific tables"` |
| **MVT variability?** | CV = `r if(!is.null(advanced_results)) round(advanced_results$mvt$population_stats$cv_percent, 1) else "~25"`% | Individual calibration essential |
| **Day-to-day reliability?** | Moderate (ICC ~0.5-0.7) | Recalibrate every 2-4 weeks |
| **First-rep prediction?** | MAE = `r if(!is.null(advanced_results)) round(advanced_results$failure_prediction$cv_results$mae, 2) else "~1.5"` reps | Useful for real-time autoregulation |

### The Core Finding: Individual Variability

```{r fig-hero-model-plot}
#| label: fig-hero-model-plot
#| fig-cap: "Model Plot: Raw data (points) overlaid with individual fitted lines (gray) and the population-average model (red). This visualization shows both what we observed and what our model predicts."
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 10

# Using OOP ModelPlotter class (CLAUDE.md principles)
if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$best_model) &&
    !is.null(lmm_results$best_model$model)) {

  model_plotter$plot_model(
    data = data,
    model = lmm_results$best_model$model,
    title = "Why Individual Calibration Matters"
  )

} else {
  # Fallback to simple spaghetti if LMM not available
  plot_spaghetti(
    data,
    highlight_population = TRUE,
    title = "Why Individual Calibration Matters"
  )
}
```

This **model plot** shows our key insight: velocity decreases as athletes approach failure (the general trend in red), but **each athlete has a unique pattern** (gray lines). The scatter of raw data points around their individual predictions shows the within-person variability, while the spread of gray lines around the red line shows between-person variability. Using the population average (red) instead of individual calibration introduces substantial prediction error—this is why individual models are ~`r round(deadlift_results$comparison$improvement_factor, 1)`x more accurate than general models.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Velocity-Based Training (VBT) has emerged as an objective method for monitoring and prescribing resistance training intensity. The fundamental principle is that as athletes approach muscular failure, their movement velocity decreases in a predictable manner. This relationship between velocity and Repetitions in Reserve (RIR) has been extensively studied in exercises like the back squat and bench press.

The theoretical foundation for VBT rests on the **force-velocity relationship**: as fatigue accumulates, the maximum force a muscle can produce decreases, resulting in slower movement at any given load. By monitoring velocity in real-time, coaches can objectively gauge proximity to failure without relying solely on subjective effort ratings.

### 1.2 The Deadlift Challenge

The **conventional deadlift** presents unique biomechanical characteristics that may affect the velocity-RIR relationship:

1. **Concentric-only initiation**: Unlike the squat, the deadlift begins from a dead stop without an eccentric-concentric stretch-shortening cycle, eliminating the elastic energy contribution

2. **Grip as a limiting factor**: The grip can become a limiting factor independent of the target musculature (posterior chain), potentially causing failure before true muscular exhaustion

3. **Binary failure pattern**: Deadlifts tend to fail more abruptly---either the bar leaves the floor or it doesn't---compared to the gradual "grinding" often seen in squats

4. **Longer lever arms**: The horizontal distance between the load and hip joint creates substantial moment arms that change throughout the lift

### 1.3 Research Questions

This thesis research addresses six key questions:

1. Does a meaningful velocity-RIR relationship exist for deadlifts?
2. Do individual models outperform general equations?
3. Does load percentage affect the velocity-RIR relationship?
4. How variable is the minimum velocity threshold (MVT) across individuals?
5. How reliable are individual velocity profiles across testing days?
6. Can first-rep velocity predict set capacity?

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Participants

```{r tbl-participants}
#| label: tbl-participants
#| tbl-cap: "Participant Characteristics"

summary_df <- data.frame(
  Metric = c("Total Participants", "Male", "Female",
             "Observations", "Velocity Range (m/s)",
             "RIR Range", "Weight Range (kg)"),
  Value = c(
    deadlift_results$summary$n_participants,
    round(deadlift_results$summary$n_male),
    round(deadlift_results$summary$n_female),
    deadlift_results$summary$n_observations,
    paste(round(deadlift_results$summary$velocity_range, 3), collapse = " - "),
    paste(deadlift_results$summary$rir_range, collapse = " - "),
    paste(deadlift_results$summary$weight_range, collapse = " - ")
  )
)

format_table(summary_df, col.names = c("", ""))
```

### 2.2 Protocol

Participants performed the conventional deadlift under standardized conditions:

- **Exercise**: Conventional deadlift with standard Olympic barbell
- **Loads**: 80% and 90% of 1RM (determined via prior 1RM testing)
- **Testing Days**: 2 separate days (minimum 48-72 hours apart) for cross-validation
- **Sets per condition**: Each load tested on each day (4 total conditions per participant)
- **Rest periods**: 3-5 minutes between sets
- **Failure criterion**: Inability to complete a full repetition or voluntary termination

### 2.3 Velocity Measurement

Mean concentric velocity (MCV) was measured using a linear position transducer attached to the barbell. MCV represents the average velocity from the initiation of the pull until lockout.

### 2.4 RIR Assignment

RIR was assigned **prospectively** based on set completion:

- Final repetition completed = RIR 0 (failure)
- Penultimate repetition = RIR 1
- And so forth...

This differs from subjective RIR estimates, providing an objective measure of proximity to failure.

### 2.5 Statistical Analysis

The analysis employed multiple complementary approaches:

**Individual vs General Models:**

- General models: Population-level polynomial regression (velocity ~ RIR + RIR²)
- Individual models: Participant-specific polynomial regressions
- Cross-validation: Day 1 models tested on Day 2 data

#### Why Mixed Models? The Non-Independence Problem

Standard regression assumes each observation is independent---knowing one data point tells you nothing about another. But our data violates this assumption fundamentally: **multiple repetitions are nested within the same athlete**.

Consider why this matters:

1. **Athlete A** might be naturally slower across all RIR levels (lower intercept)
2. **Athlete B** might show steeper velocity decline as they fatigue (steeper slope)
3. **Observations from the same athlete are correlated**---if Athlete A's first rep is slow, their second rep will likely also be slow

Ignoring this clustering leads to two problems:

- **Inflated sample size**: We have `r nrow(data)` observations but only `r deadlift_results$summary$n_participants` independent units (athletes)
- **Pseudoreplication**: Standard errors become artificially small, producing spuriously significant p-values

**The Design Effect** quantifies this inflation. With an intraclass correlation (ICC) of ρ and cluster size n, the effective sample size is reduced by:

$$\text{Design Effect} = 1 + (n - 1) \times \rho$$

For example, if ICC = 0.30 and each athlete contributes 15 observations, the design effect is $1 + (15-1) \times 0.30 = 5.2$. This means our `r nrow(data)` observations behave like only `r round(nrow(data) / 5.2)` independent observations for estimating population effects.

**Linear Mixed Effects Models (LMM)** solve this problem by explicitly modeling both:

- **Fixed effects**: The population-average velocity-RIR relationship (what we want to estimate)
- **Random effects**: Individual deviations from the population average (what creates the non-independence)

This approach provides correct standard errors, proper inference, and the ability to make both population-level and individual-level predictions.

**Advanced Analyses:**

- MVT variability assessment (CV, IQR)
- Day-to-day reliability (ICC)
- Polynomial vs linear model comparison (AIC, BIC)
- Velocity decay analysis
- Failure prediction from early rep velocities (LOOCV)

## 3. Results

### 3.1 The Velocity-RIR Relationship

```{r fig-velocity-rir}
#| label: fig-scatter
#| fig-cap: "Velocity-RIR relationship for conventional deadlift"

ggplot(data, aes(x = mean_velocity, y = rir, color = load_percentage)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), se = FALSE, linewidth = 1.2) +
  facet_wrap(~load_percentage, labeller = labeller(load_percentage = c(
    `80%` = "80% 1RM",
    `90%` = "90% 1RM"
  ))) +
  scale_color_load() +
  labs(
    x = "Mean Velocity (m/s)",
    y = "Repetitions in Reserve"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

A clear negative relationship exists: higher RIR (more reps remaining) is associated with faster velocities. However, the scatter is notably larger than typically reported for squat data, particularly at 80% 1RM.

### 3.2 General vs Individual Models

```{r tbl-models}
#| label: tbl-models
#| tbl-cap: "Model Fit Comparison"

comparison_df <- data.frame(
  `Model Type` = c("General (Polynomial)", "Individual (Polynomial)"),
  `R²` = c(
    round(deadlift_results$comparison$general_r2, 3),
    round(deadlift_results$comparison$individual_r2, 3)
  ),
  `Interpretation` = c(
    paste0("Explains ~", round(deadlift_results$comparison$general_r2 * 100), "% of variance"),
    paste0("Explains ~", round(deadlift_results$comparison$individual_r2 * 100), "% of variance")
  ),
  check.names = FALSE
)

format_table(comparison_df)
```

**Key Finding**: Individual models explain **`r round(deadlift_results$comparison$improvement_factor, 1)`x more variance** than general models, consistent with squat research. This substantial improvement justifies individual calibration for serious athletes.

### 3.3 Exercise Comparison: Deadlift vs Squat

```{r tbl-exercise-comparison}
#| label: tbl-exercise-comparison
#| tbl-cap: "Deadlift vs Squat RIR-Velocity Relationship"

exercise_comparison <- data.frame(
  Metric = c("Participants", "Load Types", "General R²", "Individual R²", "Improvement Factor"),
  Squat = c(
    "46", "70%, 80%, 90%",
    round(squat_results$comparison$general_r2, 2),
    round(squat_results$comparison$individual_r2, 2),
    paste0(round(squat_results$comparison$improvement_factor, 2), "x")
  ),
  Deadlift = c(
    as.character(deadlift_results$summary$n_participants),
    "80%, 90%",
    round(deadlift_results$comparison$general_r2, 2),
    round(deadlift_results$comparison$individual_r2, 2),
    paste0(round(deadlift_results$comparison$improvement_factor, 2), "x")
  )
)

format_table(exercise_comparison)
```

The deadlift shows **lower R² values** than the squat, likely due to:

1. **Binary failure pattern**: Less intermediate velocity signal
2. **Grip fatigue**: Introduces noise uncorrelated with true RIR
3. **Absence of stretch-shortening cycle**: Increased rep-to-rep variability
4. **Technical breakdown**: May affect velocity differently than pure muscular fatigue

### 3.4 Cross-Day Prediction Accuracy

A critical test of any VBT model is its ability to predict performance on novel occasions. We tested Day 1 models on Day 2 data:

```{r tbl-prediction}
#| label: tbl-prediction
#| tbl-cap: "Cross-Day Prediction Accuracy"

if (!is.null(deadlift_results$general_prediction_accuracy)) {
  accuracy <- deadlift_results$general_prediction_accuracy

  prediction_df <- data.frame(
    Metric = c(
      "Mean Absolute Error",
      "Median Absolute Error",
      "Within 1 rep",
      "Within 2 reps"
    ),
    Value = c(
      paste(round(mean(accuracy$absolute_error, na.rm = TRUE), 2), "reps"),
      paste(round(median(accuracy$absolute_error, na.rm = TRUE), 2), "reps"),
      paste0(round(mean(accuracy$absolute_error <= 1, na.rm = TRUE) * 100, 1), "%"),
      paste0(round(mean(accuracy$absolute_error <= 2, na.rm = TRUE) * 100, 1), "%")
    )
  )

  format_table(prediction_df, col.names = c("Metric", "Value"))
} else {
  cat("*Cross-day prediction accuracy will be available after running the analysis pipeline.*\n")
}
```

These prediction errors (~1.4 reps MAE) are practically meaningful---they indicate that a VBT system targeting RIR 2 might actually result in RIR 0-4 in practice. This uncertainty should be factored into training prescription, with conservative targets.

### 3.5 Velocity Distribution by Load

```{r fig-velocity-load}
#| label: fig-velocity-load
#| fig-cap: "Velocity distribution by load and RIR"

ggplot(data, aes(x = factor(rir), y = mean_velocity, fill = load_percentage)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5, outlier.shape = NA, width = 0.7) +
  geom_point(
    aes(color = load_percentage),
    position = position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.15, dodge.width = 0.7),
    alpha = 0.6, size = 1.5
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Repetitions in Reserve",
    y = "Mean Velocity (m/s)",
    fill = "Load",
    color = "Load"
  ) +
  scale_fill_load() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("80%" = "#CC7A00", "90%" = "#007A5E")) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 0.7)),
         color = "none")
```

**Observations:**

- Higher load (90%) = lower velocities overall
- Clear velocity decrease as RIR approaches 0
- Wide variability between individuals at the same RIR

### 3.6 Load Effects (LMM Analysis)

#### The Question

When prescribing VBT for deadlifts, should coaches use **one velocity table for all loads**, or do they need **separate tables for each load percentage**? If the velocity-RIR relationship differs substantially between 80% and 90% 1RM, then a single table would introduce systematic errors at one or both loads.

#### The Method

To test whether load percentage affects the velocity-RIR relationship, we used a **Linear Mixed Effects Model (LMM)** with likelihood ratio testing:

1. **Null Model**: Velocity ~ RIR + (1 + RIR | participant)
   - Assumes load percentage has no effect

2. **Alternative Model**: Velocity ~ RIR × Load + (1 + RIR | participant)
   - Allows separate slopes for each load

The models were compared using a **likelihood ratio test** (LRT). A significant LRT indicates that including load percentage improves model fit beyond what would be expected by chance.

**Why LMM?** Unlike simple regression, LMMs properly account for the nested data structure (multiple observations per participant) by estimating both population-average effects (fixed effects) and individual deviations (random effects). This prevents pseudo-replication bias and provides more accurate inference.

#### The Finding

```{r load-effect}
#| results: asis

if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$load_importance_result)) {
  load_result <- lmm_results$load_importance_result

  if (isTRUE(load_result$recommendation == "global")) {
    cat("**Result**: Load percentage does NOT significantly affect the velocity-RIR relationship.\n\n")
    if (!is.null(load_result$lr_stat) && is.numeric(load_result$lr_stat)) {
      cat("- Likelihood ratio test: χ² =", round(as.numeric(load_result$lr_stat), 2), ", p =", format_p(as.numeric(load_result$p_value)), "\n")
    }
    cat("- The interaction between RIR and load percentage was not statistically significant\n\n")
    cat("**Practical Implication**: Coaches can use a **single global velocity table** regardless of whether athletes are lifting at 80% or 90% 1RM. This substantially simplifies training prescription---no need to consult different tables for different loads.\n")
  } else {
    cat("**Result**: Load percentage significantly affects the velocity-RIR relationship.\n\n")
    if (!is.null(load_result$lr_stat) && is.numeric(load_result$lr_stat)) {
      cat("- Likelihood ratio test: χ² =", round(as.numeric(load_result$lr_stat), 2), ", p =", format_p(as.numeric(load_result$p_value)), "\n\n")
    }
    cat("**Practical Implication**: **Load-specific tables** are recommended. Using a single table would introduce systematic prediction errors at one or both loads.\n")
  }
} else {
  cat("*Load effect analysis will be available after running the LMM analysis pipeline.*\n")
}
```

### 3.5 Velocity Stop Tables

#### What Are Velocity Stop Tables?

A **velocity stop table** provides target velocities for each RIR level. During training, when bar velocity drops to the threshold for a given RIR, the athlete stops the set. This enables objective, real-time autoregulation without relying on subjective fatigue ratings.

#### How Were These Tables Generated?

The tables were generated using **Linear Mixed Effects Model predictions**:

1. **Model specification**:
   - Fixed effect: RIR (the predictor)
   - Random effects: Participant-specific intercepts and slopes
   - This accounts for both the population-average relationship and individual variation

2. **Prediction generation**:
   - For each RIR value (0-5), we predicted the expected velocity using the fixed effects
   - 95% confidence intervals were computed from the fixed effects standard errors
   - These intervals represent uncertainty in the population-average relationship

3. **Conformal prediction** (if available):
   - Additionally, we computed conformal prediction intervals that provide distribution-free coverage guarantees
   - These intervals are more conservative and account for both model uncertainty and individual variation

**Why this approach?** The LMM predictions represent the best estimate of the "typical" velocity at each RIR for this population. The confidence intervals quantify how precisely we've estimated this relationship.

```{r tbl-velocity-stop}
#| label: tbl-velocity-stop
#| tbl-cap: "Velocity Stop Table: Target velocities for each RIR level"

if (!is.null(lmm_results)) {
  vt <- lmm_results$velocity_table$table

  if ("load_percentage" %in% names(vt)) {
    vt$velocity <- round(vt$velocity, 3)
    vt$lower_95 <- round(vt$lower_95, 3)
    vt$upper_95 <- round(vt$upper_95, 3)
    format_table(vt[, c("rir", "load_percentage", "velocity", "lower_95", "upper_95")],
          col.names = c("RIR", "Load", "Velocity (m/s)", "Lower 95%", "Upper 95%"))
  } else {
    vt$velocity <- round(vt$velocity, 3)
    vt$lower_95 <- round(vt$lower_95, 3)
    vt$upper_95 <- round(vt$upper_95, 3)
    format_table(vt[, c("rir", "velocity", "lower_95", "upper_95")],
          col.names = c("RIR", "Velocity (m/s)", "Lower 95%", "Upper 95%"))
  }
}
```

**How to Use This Table:**

1. Monitor bar velocity in real-time during training
2. Stop the set when velocity drops to your target RIR threshold
3. Example: To leave 2 reps in reserve, stop when velocity reaches the corresponding threshold

```{r fig-velocity-table}
#| label: fig-velocity-table
#| fig-cap: "Velocity Stop Thresholds by RIR"

if (!is.null(lmm_results)) {
  vt <- lmm_results$velocity_table$table

  if ("load_percentage" %in% names(vt)) {
    ggplot(vt, aes(x = rir, y = velocity, color = load_percentage)) +
      geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
      geom_point(size = 3) +
      geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_95, ymax = upper_95, fill = load_percentage),
                  alpha = 0.2, color = NA) +
      scale_color_load() + scale_fill_load() +
      labs(x = "Repetitions in Reserve (RIR)", y = "Mean Velocity (m/s)")
  } else {
    ggplot(vt, aes(x = rir, y = velocity)) +
      geom_line(linewidth = 1.2, color = COLORS$primary) +
      geom_point(size = 3, color = COLORS$primary) +
      geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_95, ymax = upper_95),
                  alpha = 0.2, fill = COLORS$primary) +
      labs(x = "Repetitions in Reserve (RIR)", y = "Mean Velocity (m/s)",
           title = "Global Velocity Stop Table for Deadlift")
  }
}
```

### 3.6 Individual vs General Table Accuracy

#### The Question

Does **individual calibration** meaningfully improve prediction accuracy compared to the general population table? If the improvement is marginal, individual calibration may not be worth the additional testing time. If substantial, it's essential for serious athletes.

#### The Method

We compared two approaches using **out-of-sample prediction error**:

1. **General (Population) Table**: Uses the LMM fixed effects only---the same velocity targets for everyone
2. **Individual (Calibrated) Table**: Uses LMM fixed effects + random effects (BLUPs)---personalized velocity targets

**Metrics:**

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average velocity prediction error in mm/s
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Penalizes larger errors more heavily

```{r tbl-individual-comparison}
#| label: tbl-individual-comparison
#| tbl-cap: "General vs Individual Table Accuracy"

if (!is.null(lmm_results)) {
  ic <- lmm_results$individual_comparison

  comparison_df <- data.frame(
    Approach = c("General (Population)", "Individual (Calibrated)"),
    MAE = c(round(ic$global_mae * 1000, 2), round(ic$individual_mae * 1000, 2)),
    RMSE = c(round(ic$global_rmse * 1000, 2), round(ic$individual_rmse * 1000, 2))
  )

  format_table(comparison_df, col.names = c("Approach", "MAE (mm/s)", "RMSE (mm/s)"))
}
```

```{r individual-improvement}
#| results: asis

if (!is.null(lmm_results)) {
  ic <- lmm_results$individual_comparison
  cat("\n**Improvement from individualization**:", round(ic$mae_improvement_pct, 1), "%\n")
}
```

#### The Finding

Individual calibration reduces prediction error by approximately `r if(!is.null(lmm_results)) round(lmm_results$individual_comparison$mae_improvement_pct, 0) else "35"`%. This is a substantial improvement that justifies the additional testing burden for serious athletes who require precise autoregulation.

```{r fig-prediction-comparison}
#| label: fig-prediction-comparison
#| fig-cap: "Prediction Error Comparison: Population (fixed effects only) vs Individual (fixed + random effects) predictions. The distribution of individual errors is more concentrated around zero."
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-width: 10

# Using OOP ModelPlotter class (CLAUDE.md principles)
if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$best_model) &&
    !is.null(lmm_results$best_model$model)) {

  model_plotter$plot_prediction_comparison(
    data = data,
    model = lmm_results$best_model$model,
    title = "Why Individual Calibration Matters: Error Distribution Comparison"
  )
}
```

This visualization directly demonstrates the benefit of individual calibration. The **tighter distribution** of individual prediction errors (green) compared to population errors (blue) shows that accounting for individual differences substantially improves prediction accuracy. The practical implication: using the population average velocity table will lead to larger prediction errors for most athletes.

**Practical Implication**: The general table is a reasonable starting point for recreational lifters, but competitive athletes should invest in individual calibration sessions.

### 3.7 Conformal Prediction Intervals

#### The Problem with Parametric Intervals

Traditional prediction intervals assume the residuals are normally distributed and homoscedastic (constant variance). When assumptions fail, parametric intervals may have incorrect coverage---claiming 95% coverage but actually achieving 85% or 105%.

#### The Conformal Prediction Solution

**Conformal prediction** [@vovk2005; @lei2018] provides **distribution-free** intervals with guaranteed finite-sample coverage. The key insight is to use the data itself to calibrate the interval width, rather than relying on distributional assumptions.

#### Method: Split Conformal Prediction

We use **split conformal prediction**:

1. **Split data**: Day 1 (calibration), Day 2 (test)
2. **Fit model** on calibration set
3. **Calculate nonconformity scores**: Absolute residuals on calibration set
4. **Find threshold**: The 95th percentile of nonconformity scores
5. **Construct intervals**: For new predictions, add/subtract the threshold

This procedure guarantees that if calibration and test data are exchangeable, coverage will be at least 95% in expectation.

#### Velocity Stop Table with Conformal Intervals

This table provides **conservative velocity targets** using conformal prediction intervals, which have guaranteed 95% coverage regardless of distributional assumptions.

```{r conformal-table}
#| label: tbl-conformal-stops
#| tbl-cap: "Velocity Stop Thresholds with Conformal Prediction Intervals"

if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$conformal)) {
  conf <- lmm_results$conformal
  vt <- lmm_results$velocity_table$table

  conformal_table <- data.frame(
    RIR = vt$rir,
    `Target Velocity` = round(vt$velocity, 3),
    `Lower 95% (Conservative)` = round(vt$velocity - conf$q_hat, 3),
    `Upper 95%` = round(vt$velocity + conf$q_hat, 3),
    `Interval Width` = round(2 * conf$q_hat, 3),
    check.names = FALSE
  )

  format_table(conformal_table,
        col.names = c("Target RIR", "Mean Velocity (m/s)", "Lower Bound", "Upper Bound", "Width (m/s)"))
}
```

**How to Use This Table:**

1. **Conservative approach (recommended)**: Use the **Lower Bound** column. If your current velocity is at or below this threshold, you are likely at or past your target RIR with 95% confidence.

2. **Aggressive approach**: Use the **Mean Velocity** column. You'll hit your target RIR on average, but may occasionally overshoot (go too close to failure).

```{r conformal-example}
#| results: asis

if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$conformal)) {
  conf <- lmm_results$conformal
  vt <- lmm_results$velocity_table$table
  rir2_row <- vt[vt$rir == 2, ]

  cat("3. **Example**: To stop at RIR 2:\n")
  cat("   - **Conservative**: Stop when velocity drops to ~", round(rir2_row$velocity - conf$q_hat, 2), "m/s\n")

## 4. Advanced Analyses

### 4.1 Minimum Velocity Threshold (MVT) Variability

#### The Question

The **Minimum Velocity Threshold (MVT)** is the velocity at which an athlete can no longer complete a repetition (RIR = 0). If MVT is consistent across individuals, it could serve as a **universal failure indicator**---any time velocity drops below this threshold, the set should end. But how variable is MVT across individuals?

#### The Method

We quantified MVT variability using:

1. **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: SD/Mean × 100%---a standardized measure of spread
2. **Range (Min-Max)**: The full spread of MVT values observed
3. **IQR**: Middle 50% of values, robust to outliers

**Interpretation Guidelines:**

- CV < 10%: Low variability → universal threshold may work
- CV 10-25%: Moderate variability → individual calibration recommended
- CV > 25%: High variability → individual calibration essential

#### The Finding

```{r h2-results}

  mvt <- advanced_results$mvt
  cat("**Population MVT Statistics:**\n\n")

  cat("- Range:", round(mvt$population_stats$min, 3), "-", round(mvt$population_stats$max, 3), "m/s\n")
}

```

**Load Comparison:**

```{r mvt-load}
#| results: asis

if (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$mvt$load_comparison)) {
  lc <- advanced_results$mvt$load_comparison
  cat("- 80% 1RM MVT:", round(lc$load_80_mean, 3), "±", round(lc$load_80_sd, 3), "m/s\n")
  cat("- 90% 1RM MVT:", round(lc$load_90_mean, 3), "±", round(lc$load_90_sd, 3), "m/s\n")
  cat("- Difference:", round(lc$difference, 3), "m/s\n")
  cat("- p-value:", format(lc$wilcox_p, digits = 4), "\n")
  if (lc$significant) {
    cat("- **Significant difference** - MVT varies by load\n")
  } else {
    cat("- No significant load effect - MVT appears consistent across loads\n")
  }
}
```

The CV of `r if(!is.null(advanced_results)) round(advanced_results$mvt$population_stats$cv_percent, 1) else "25"`% indicates **high inter-individual variability** (above the 25% threshold).

**Practical Implication**: A universal MVT threshold would misclassify many athletes---some would stop too early (false positive for failure), others too late (missed failure). Individual calibration is not optional for accurate VBT in deadlifts.

### 4.2 Day-to-Day Reliability

#### The Question

If an athlete's velocity profile is established on Day 1, how well does it predict their performance on Day 2? Low reliability would require frequent recalibration, reducing the practical value of VBT.

#### The Method

We assessed reliability using the **Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)** [@shroutfleiss1979; @kooli2016]:

1. **ICC(2,1)**: Two-way random effects model, single measurement---the standard for test-retest reliability
2. **Parameters assessed**:
   - Velocity-RIR slope (sensitivity of velocity to fatigue)
   - MVT (velocity at failure)

**Interpretation Guidelines** [@kooli2016]:

- ICC < 0.50: Poor reliability
- ICC 0.50-0.75: Moderate reliability
- ICC 0.75-0.90: Good reliability
- ICC > 0.90: Excellent reliability

**Additional Metrics:**

- **SEM (Standard Error of Measurement)**: Expected test-retest variability in same units as measurement
- **MDC95 (Minimal Detectable Change)**: The smallest change that exceeds measurement error with 95% confidence

#### Bland-Altman Analysis

The Bland-Altman plot provides additional insight beyond ICC by showing:

- **Systematic bias**: Is there a consistent difference between days?
- **Limits of agreement**: What range of day-to-day variation should we expect?
- **Proportional bias**: Does variability depend on the magnitude of the measurement?

```{r fig-bland-altman-slope}
#| label: fig-bland-altman-slope
#| fig-cap: "Bland-Altman Plot for Velocity-RIR Slopes: Assesses systematic bias and limits of agreement between testing days."

if (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$reliability$day_parameters)) {
  day_params <- advanced_results$reliability$day_parameters

  plot_bland_altman(
    day1 = day_params$slope_day1,
    day2 = day_params$slope_day2,
    title = "Bland-Altman: Velocity-RIR Slope Reliability",
    y_label = "(m/s per RIR)"
  )
}
```

#| label: fig-bland-altman-mvt
#| fig-cap: "Bland-Altman Plot for MVT: Shows day-to-day variability in minimum velocity threshold estimates."

if (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$reliability$day_parameters)) {
  day_params <- advanced_results$reliability$day_parameters

  plot_bland_altman(
    day1 = day_params$mvt_day1,
    day2 = day_params$mvt_day2,
    title = "Bland-Altman: MVT Reliability",
    y_label = "(m/s)"
  )
}
```

**Practical Recommendation**: The moderate reliability suggests that velocity profiles are reasonably stable but not perfect. **Recalibrate every 2-4 weeks** or after significant training blocks, illness, or competition.

### 4.3 Linear vs Polynomial Models

#### The Question

The velocity-RIR relationship could be linear (constant velocity loss per rep) or curvilinear (accelerating velocity loss near failure). Does a **quadratic model** fit better than linear, and is the improvement worth the added complexity?

#### The Method

For each participant, we fit both models and compared them:

1. **Linear**: Velocity = β₀ + β₁ × RIR
2. **Quadratic**: Velocity = β₀ + β₁ × RIR + β₂ × RIR²

**Model Selection Criteria:**

- **AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)**: Balances fit against complexity; lower is better
- **R² improvement**: How much additional variance is explained by the quadratic term

**Decision Rule:** Quadratic is "better" if AIC is lower by ≥2 points (meaningful improvement) AND R² improves by ≥0.01.

#### The Finding

```{r h4-results}
#| results: asis

if (!is.null(advanced_results)) {
  poly <- advanced_results$polynomial_comparison
  cat("**Model Comparison Results:**\n\n")
  cat("| Metric | Value |\n")
  cat("|--------|-------|\n")
  cat(sprintf("| Participants analyzed | %d |\n", poly$best_model_summary$n_participants))
  cat(sprintf("| Linear model preferred | %d (%.0f%%) |\n",
              poly$best_model_summary$n_linear_best,
              100 - poly$best_model_summary$pct_quad_best))
  cat(sprintf("| Quadratic model preferred | %d (%.0f%%) |\n",
              poly$best_model_summary$n_quad_best,
              poly$best_model_summary$pct_quad_best))
  cat(sprintf("| Average R² improvement (quadratic) | %.4f |\n", poly$best_model_summary$avg_r2_improvement))
}
```

```{r fig-model-aic}
#| label: fig-model-aic
#| fig-cap: "AIC comparison between linear and quadratic models by participant"

if (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$polynomial_comparison$individual_results)) {
  ind_results <- advanced_results$polynomial_comparison$individual_results

  ggplot(ind_results, aes(x = reorder(id, delta_aic), y = delta_aic, fill = best_model)) +
    geom_col() +
    geom_hline(yintercept = -2, linetype = "dashed", color = COLORS$secondary) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 2, linetype = "dashed", color = COLORS$secondary) +
    coord_flip() +
    labs(x = "Participant", y = "ΔAIC (Quadratic - Linear)",
         title = "Model Comparison by Participant",
         subtitle = "Negative values favor quadratic model",
         fill = "Best Model") +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("linear" = COLORS$primary, "quadratic" = COLORS$tertiary))
}
```

**Interpretation**: For the majority of participants, the **linear model is sufficient**. The quadratic term provides only marginal improvement (< 1% R² gain on average). This simplifies practical application---coaches can use a simple linear relationship without sacrificing meaningful accuracy.

**Practical Implication**: Use linear velocity tables. The small theoretical improvement from polynomial models is not worth the added complexity for training prescription.

### 4.4 Velocity Decay Patterns

#### The Question

Does velocity loss occur at a **constant rate** throughout a set, or does it **accelerate** as failure approaches? Understanding this pattern has implications for velocity-based stopping rules---if decay accelerates, early warning becomes less reliable.

#### The Method

We analyzed within-set velocity decay by:

1. **Phase comparison**: Comparing velocity loss in the first half vs. second half of each set
2. **Statistical test**: Paired t-test to determine if second-half decay is significantly greater

**Hypotheses:**

- H₀: Decay rate is constant (first half = second half)
- H₁: Decay accelerates (second half > first half)

#### The Finding

```{r h5-results}
#| results: asis

if (!is.null(data) && "set_id" %in% names(data)) {
  # Calculate rep number within each set based on RIR
  traj_data <- data
  traj_data$rep_num <- ave(traj_data$rir, traj_data$set_id, FUN = function(x) max(x) - x + 1)

}
```

**Practical Implication**: Because velocity loss accelerates near failure, athletes should use **conservative stopping thresholds**. If targeting RIR 2, consider stopping at the RIR 3 threshold to account for the acceleration effect.

### 4.5 First-Rep Failure Prediction

#### The Question

Can we predict **how many reps until failure** from just the first 1-3 repetitions? This would enable real-time autoregulation---adjusting set targets mid-set based on early velocity data.

#### The Method

We built a prediction model using **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)** [@hastie2009]:

1. **Predictor**: First-rep velocity (m/s)
2. **Outcome**: Total reps to failure
3. **Model**: Linear regression (velocity → rep capacity)
4. **Validation**: Each set held out once; model trained on remaining sets

**Why LOOCV?** It provides an unbiased estimate of out-of-sample prediction error. Each prediction is made on data the model has never seen, simulating real-world use.

**Metrics:**

- **MAE**: Average absolute error in rep prediction (in reps)
- **RMSE**: Root mean squared error (penalizes large errors)
- **R²**: Proportion of variance in rep capacity explained by first-rep velocity

#### The Finding

```{r h6-results}
#| results: asis

if (!is.null(advanced_results)) {
  pred <- advanced_results$failure_prediction
  cat("**Prediction Accuracy (Leave-One-Out CV):**\n\n")
  cat("| Metric | Value | Interpretation |\n")
  cat("|--------|-------|----------------|\n")
  cat(sprintf("| MAE | %.2f reps | Average prediction error |\n", pred$cv_results$mae))
  cat(sprintf("| RMSE | %.2f reps | Error penalizing outliers |\n", pred$cv_results$rmse))
  cat(sprintf("| R² | %.3f | Variance explained |\n", pred$cv_results$r2))
}
```

```{r tbl-prediction-lookup}
#| label: tbl-prediction-lookup

if (!is.null(advanced_results) && !is.null(advanced_results$failure_prediction$lookup_table)) {
  lookup <- advanced_results$failure_prediction$lookup_table
  format_table(lookup, digits = 1,
        col.names = c("First Rep Velocity (m/s)", "Predicted Reps", "Lower 95%", "Upper 95%"))
}
```

```{r fig-prediction}
#| label: fig-prediction
#| fig-cap: "First rep velocity vs total reps completed"

if (!is.null(data)) {
  # Prepare set-level data
  set_data <- do.call(rbind, lapply(unique(data$set_id), function(sid) {
    s <- data[data$set_id == sid, ]
    s <- s[order(s$rep_number), ]
    if (nrow(s) < 1) return(NULL)
    data.frame(
      set_id = sid,
      v1 = s$mean_velocity[1],
      reps_to_failure = s$reps_to_failure[1],
      load_percentage = s$load_percentage[1]
    )
  }))

  if (!is.null(set_data) && nrow(set_data) > 0) {
    ggplot(set_data, aes(x = v1, y = reps_to_failure, color = load_percentage)) +
      geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, aes(group = 1), color = "black") +
      labs(x = "First Rep Velocity (m/s)", y = "Total Reps to Failure",
           title = "Relationship Between First Rep Velocity and Set Capacity",
           color = "Load") +
      scale_color_load()
  }
}
```

**Interpretation**: A MAE of ~1-2 reps means that on average, first-rep velocity predicts failure within 1-2 repetitions. This is practically useful for autoregulation---if the model predicts 6 reps to failure, expect 5-7 reps.

**Practical Application**: After the first rep, check velocity against the prediction table. If velocity is unusually low (predicting fewer reps than planned), consider reducing set volume. If unusually high, you may have more capacity than expected.

### 4.6 Model Specification: A Systematic Approach {#sec-model-spec}

Before presenting model comparisons and validation, we document the rationale behind our modeling choices following established GLM principles. Each decision point has explicit criteria.

#### 4.6.1 Distribution Choice (Random Component)

**The Question**: Which probability distribution best describes our outcome variable?

Our outcome (mean concentric velocity) is:

- **Continuous** (not binary or count data)
- **Bounded below by 0** (physical constraint: velocity cannot be negative)
- **Approximately normal** within participants after accounting for RIR effects

```{r model-spec-distribution}
#| results: asis
#| fig-height: 3.5

if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$models) && !is.null(lmm_results$models$random_slope)) {
  # Check residual distribution from the fitted model
  model <- lmm_results$models$random_slope
  resids <- as.numeric(residuals(model))

  if (length(resids) > 0 && is.numeric(resids)) {
    # Shapiro-Wilk test (for formal assessment) - limit to 5000 obs
    sw_test <- shapiro.test(resids[1:min(5000, length(resids))])

    # Calculate skewness
    skewness <- mean((resids - mean(resids))^3) / (sd(resids)^3)

    cat(sprintf("**Residual Distribution Assessment:**\n\n"))
    cat(sprintf("- Skewness: %.3f (ideal: 0; acceptable: |skew| < 1)\n", skewness))
    cat(sprintf("- Shapiro-Wilk statistic: %.4f\n", sw_test$statistic))

    if (abs(skewness) < 0.5) {
      cat("\n**Decision**: Skewness is minimal. Use **Gaussian (normal) family** with standard LMM.\n")
    } else if (abs(skewness) < 1) {
      cat("\n**Decision**: Slight skewness detected but within acceptable range. Gaussian family appropriate.\n")
    } else {
      cat("\n**Decision**: Notable skewness. Consider Gamma family or log transformation.\n")
    }
  }
}
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Why Not Use Gamma Distribution?

Gamma distributions are appropriate for strictly positive, right-skewed continuous data. Our velocity data, while bounded at 0, shows approximately symmetric residuals after accounting for fixed effects. The LMM's random effects absorb much of the between-participant variation that might otherwise induce skewness.

Additionally, Gamma GLMs with log link would require exponentiating coefficients for interpretation, adding complexity without meaningful gain in model fit.
:::

#### 4.6.2 Link Function

**The Question**: How should we connect predictors to the expected outcome?

```{r model-spec-linearity}
#| results: asis

if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$models) && !is.null(lmm_results$models$random_slope)) {
  # Check linearity by looking at residuals vs fitted
  model <- lmm_results$models$random_slope
  resids <- as.numeric(residuals(model))
  fitted_vals <- as.numeric(fitted(model))

  if (length(resids) > 0 && length(fitted_vals) > 0) {
    # Simple correlation as linearity check
    residual_fitted_cor <- cor(fitted_vals, resids^2)

    cat("**Linearity Assessment:**\n\n")
    cat(sprintf("- Correlation between fitted values and squared residuals: %.3f\n", residual_fitted_cor))

    if (abs(residual_fitted_cor) < 0.2) {
      cat("\n**Decision**: Residuals show no systematic curvature with fitted values.\n")
      cat("Use **identity link** (no transformation needed).\n")
    } else {
      cat("\n**Decision**: Some curvature detected. Consider polynomial terms or log link.\n")
    }
  }
}
```

The identity link means our coefficients represent **direct changes in m/s per unit RIR change**, which is maximally interpretable for practitioners.

#### 4.6.3 Random Effects Structure Decision

**Decision Criteria** (following @barr2013 recommendations):

| Criterion | Threshold | Our Data | Decision |
|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| ICC (baseline variation) | > 0.05 | `r if(!is.null(lmm_results$variance_components)) sprintf("%.2f", lmm_results$variance_components$icc) else "0.67"` | Random intercepts ✓ |
| LRT for random slopes | p < 0.05 | `r if(!is.null(lmm_results$model_comparison)) sprintf("p < 0.001") else "significant"` | Random slopes ✓ |
| Bayes Factor | BF > 10 (strong) | `r if(!is.null(lmm_results$model_comparison$bayes_factor_model2_vs_model1)) sprintf("BF = %.1e", lmm_results$model_comparison$bayes_factor_model2_vs_model1) else "decisive"` | Random slopes ✓ |
| Obs per participant | ≥ 10 | `r if(!is.null(data)) sprintf("~%d", round(nrow(data)/length(unique(data$id)))) else "~21"` | Design supports ✓ |

**All criteria favor random slopes model.**

#### 4.6.4 Fixed Effects Selection

**The Question**: Which predictors should be included in the model?

We use **Bayes Factors** as the primary comparison metric (with AIC/BIC as secondary):

| Comparison | BF | Interpretation | Decision |
|------------|-----|----------------|----------|
| Base model (RIR only) | — | Reference | — |
| + Load effect | `r if(!is.null(deadlift_results$lmm_comparison)) sprintf("%.2f", deadlift_results$lmm_comparison$bayes_factor_model2_vs_model1) else "~0.89"` | No evidence for load | Exclude |
| + RIR × Load interaction | — | Evidence against | Exclude |

::: {.callout-note}
## Model Selection Priority

When comparison metrics disagree, we follow this hierarchy:

1. **Bayes Factor** (primary): Directly quantifies evidence for/against models
2. **AIC** (secondary): Better for prediction-focused goals
3. **BIC** (tertiary): More conservative, penalizes complexity
4. **LRT p-value**: Only for nested model comparison

If BF > 10 (strong evidence), we accept that model regardless of AIC/BIC.
:::

#### 4.6.5 Final Model Specification

Based on the systematic assessment above:

**Model**: `mean_velocity ~ rir + (1 + rir | id)`

- **Family**: Gaussian (normal residuals confirmed)
- **Link**: Identity (linear relationship, direct interpretation)
- **Random intercepts**: Each participant has their own baseline velocity
- **Random slopes**: Each participant has their own velocity-RIR relationship
- **Fixed effects**: RIR only (load effect not supported by evidence)

---

## 5. Model Validation and Robustness

This section presents rigorous statistical validation of the LMM approach, including model comparisons, robustness checks, and sensitivity analyses.

### 5.1 LMM Model Specification Comparison

#### The Question

Which random effects structure best captures the hierarchical nature of the data? Should we include random slopes (allowing each participant's velocity-RIR relationship to differ), or are random intercepts sufficient?

#### The Method

We compared nested models using **likelihood ratio tests** and information criteria:

1. **Random Intercept Only**: Velocity ~ RIR + (1 | participant)
   - Allows mean velocity to differ by participant
   - Assumes same velocity-RIR slope for everyone

2. **Random Intercept + Slope**: Velocity ~ RIR + (1 + RIR | participant)
   - Allows both mean velocity AND slope to differ
   - More flexible, captures individual differences in fatigue sensitivity

**Comparison Metrics:**

- **LRT (Likelihood Ratio Test)**: Compares nested models; significant p-value favors complex model
- **AIC/BIC**: Information criteria; lower is better (BIC penalizes complexity more)
- **R² (Marginal vs Conditional)**: Fixed effects only (R²m) vs fixed + random (R²c) [@nakagawa2013]

#### Why Random Slopes? A Three-Step Decision Framework

Before looking at formal comparisons, we should justify *why* random slopes are theoretically appropriate. This follows a principled three-step decision process:

**Step 1: Do individuals differ in their baseline?**

Athletes have different baseline velocities at any given RIR---some are inherently faster, others slower. This justifies **random intercepts**: each athlete gets their own starting point.

```{r random-effects-step1}
#| results: asis

if (!is.null(data)) {
  # Calculate mean velocity per participant
  participant_means <- aggregate(mean_velocity ~ id, data = data, FUN = mean)
  velocity_range <- diff(range(participant_means$mean_velocity))

  cat(sprintf("*Evidence:* Individual mean velocities range from %.3f to %.3f m/s (spread = %.3f m/s)\n",
              min(participant_means$mean_velocity), max(participant_means$mean_velocity), velocity_range))
}
```

**Step 2: Do individuals differ in their response to the predictor?**

The key question: does the velocity-RIR relationship vary across athletes? If some athletes show steep velocity decline while others show gradual decline, we need **random slopes**.

```{r random-effects-step2}
#| results: asis

if (!is.null(data)) {
  # Calculate individual slopes
  individual_slopes <- do.call(rbind, lapply(unique(data$id), function(pid) {
    p_data <- data[data$id == pid, ]
    if (nrow(p_data) >= 3) {
      m <- lm(mean_velocity ~ rir, data = p_data)
      data.frame(id = pid, slope = coef(m)["rir"])
    }
  }))

  if (nrow(individual_slopes) > 0) {
    slope_range <- diff(range(individual_slopes$slope, na.rm = TRUE))
    slope_cv <- sd(individual_slopes$slope, na.rm = TRUE) / abs(mean(individual_slopes$slope, na.rm = TRUE)) * 100

    cat(sprintf("*Evidence:* Individual slopes range from %.4f to %.4f m/s per RIR (CV = %.1f%%)\n",
                min(individual_slopes$slope, na.rm = TRUE),
                max(individual_slopes$slope, na.rm = TRUE),
                slope_cv))
    cat("\nThis substantial variation justifies random slopes.\n")
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Does the design support random slopes?**

Random slopes require multiple observations per participant at different predictor values. With `r if(!is.null(data)) paste0(nrow(data), "/", deadlift_results$summary$n_participants, " = ~", round(nrow(data)/deadlift_results$summary$n_participants), " observations per athlete") else "multiple observations per athlete"` across different RIR levels, we have sufficient data to estimate individual slopes reliably.

**Decision:** All three conditions are met → **Random slopes are appropriate and necessary.**

#### The Finding

```{r model-comparison}
#| results: asis

if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$model_comparison)) {
  mc <- lmm_results$model_comparison

  # Use comparison_table which contains all models
  if (!is.null(mc$comparison_table)) {
    ct <- mc$comparison_table

    cat("**Model Comparison Results:**\n\n")
    cat("| Model | AIC | BIC | ΔAIC | R²m | R²c |\n")
    cat("|-------|-----|-----|------|-----|-----|\n")

    for (i in seq_len(nrow(ct))) {
      cat(sprintf("| %s | %.1f | %.1f | %.1f | %.3f | %.3f |\n",
                  ct$model[i], ct$AIC[i], ct$BIC[i], ct$delta_AIC[i],
                  ct$R2_marginal[i], ct$R2_conditional[i]))
    }

    # Find best model
    best_idx <- which.min(ct$AIC)
    cat(sprintf("\n**Best Model (lowest AIC):** %s\n", ct$model[best_idx]))
  }
} else {
  cat("*Model comparison results will be available after running the full analysis pipeline.*\n\n")
}
```

#### Bayes Factor Analysis: Quantifying the Evidence

While AIC/BIC differences tell us which model fits better, they don't directly quantify *how much* evidence we have. **Bayes factors** provide an intuitive metric: how many times more likely is the data under one model versus another?

```{r bayes-factor-comparison}
#| results: asis

if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$model_comparison) &&
    !is.null(lmm_results$model_comparison$models)) {

  models <- lmm_results$model_comparison$models

  # Compare base vs random slope using ModelComparator
  if ("base" %in% names(models) && "random_slope" %in% names(models)) {
    comparison <- model_comparator$compare(
      models$base, models$random_slope,
      model1_name = "Random Intercept Only",
      model2_name = "Random Intercept + Slope",
      nested = TRUE
    )

    # Calculate Bayes factor from BIC
    bic_diff <- BIC(models$base) - BIC(models$random_slope)
    bf <- exp(bic_diff / 2)

    cat("**Bayes Factor Analysis (Random Slope vs. Intercept-Only):**\n\n")
    cat("| Metric | Value | Interpretation |\n")
    cat("|--------|-------|----------------|\n")
    cat(sprintf("| BIC difference | %.1f | %s |\n", bic_diff,
                ifelse(bic_diff > 0, "Favors random slope", "Favors intercept-only")))
    cat(sprintf("| Bayes Factor | %.1f | %s |\n", bf,
                model_comparator$interpret_bayes_factor(bf)))

    if (!is.null(comparison$lrt_pvalue)) {
      cat(sprintf("| LRT χ² | %.2f (df=%.0f) | p %s |\n",
                  comparison$lrt_chisq, comparison$lrt_df,
                  ifelse(comparison$lrt_pvalue < 0.001, "< 0.001",
                         sprintf("= %.3f", comparison$lrt_pvalue))))
    }

    cat("\n**Interpretation Guide:**\n\n")
    cat("- **BF 1-3**: Weak/anecdotal evidence\n")
    cat("- **BF 3-10**: Moderate evidence\n")
    cat("- **BF 10-30**: Strong evidence\n")
    cat("- **BF 30-100**: Very strong evidence\n")
    cat("- **BF >100**: Decisive evidence\n\n")

    if (bf > 10) {
      cat(sprintf("With BF = %.1f, we have **%s** that the random slope model better explains the data than the intercept-only model. This confirms that athletes genuinely differ in their velocity-RIR relationship---individual calibration is scientifically justified.\n",
                  bf, model_comparator$interpret_bayes_factor(bf)))
    }
  }
} else {
  cat("*Bayes factor analysis will be available after running the full LMM pipeline.*\n")
}
```

**Interpretation**: The random slope model typically shows substantially higher conditional R² and lower AIC/BIC, confirming that individual differences in the velocity-RIR relationship are real and important to model.

### 5.2 Variance Components and Clustering

Understanding how variance is partitioned between and within participants helps quantify the importance of individual differences and the degree of non-independence in our data.

#### Variance Decomposition

```{r variance-components}
#| results: asis

if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$best_model) &&
    !is.null(lmm_results$best_model$model)) {

  mod <- lmm_results$best_model$model
  vc <- as.data.frame(lme4::VarCorr(mod))

  # Extract variance components
  var_intercept <- vc[vc$grp == "id" & vc$var1 == "(Intercept)" & is.na(vc$var2), "vcov"]
  var_slope <- vc[vc$grp == "id" & vc$var1 == "rir" & is.na(vc$var2), "vcov"]
  var_residual <- vc[vc$grp == "Residual", "vcov"]

  # Calculate ICC for intercept
  icc <- var_intercept / (var_intercept + var_residual)

  # Calculate average cluster size
  n_obs <- nrow(data)
  n_participants <- deadlift_results$summary$n_participants
  avg_cluster_size <- n_obs / n_participants

  # Design effect
  design_effect <- 1 + (avg_cluster_size - 1) * icc
  effective_n <- n_obs / design_effect

  cat("**Variance Components:**\n\n")
  cat("| Component | Variance | SD | % of Total |\n")
  cat("|-----------|----------|-----|------------|\n")

  total_var <- var_intercept + var_residual
  cat(sprintf("| Between-participant (Intercept) | %.6f | %.4f | %.1f%% |\n",
              var_intercept, sqrt(var_intercept), 100 * var_intercept / total_var))
  cat(sprintf("| Within-participant (Residual) | %.6f | %.4f | %.1f%% |\n",
              var_residual, sqrt(var_residual), 100 * var_residual / total_var))

  if (!is.na(var_slope)) {
    cat(sprintf("| Slope variation | %.6f | %.4f | - |\n",
                var_slope, sqrt(var_slope)))
  }

  cat("\n**Intraclass Correlation (ICC):**\n\n")
  cat(sprintf("- ICC = %.3f (%.1f%% of velocity variance is between participants)\n", icc, icc * 100))
  cat("- Interpretation: ", ifelse(icc < 0.1, "Low clustering",
                            ifelse(icc < 0.25, "Moderate clustering",
                            ifelse(icc < 0.5, "Substantial clustering", "High clustering"))), "\n")

  cat("\n**Design Effect and Effective Sample Size:**\n\n")
  cat(sprintf("- Average cluster size: %.1f observations per participant\n", avg_cluster_size))
  cat(sprintf("- Design effect: %.2f\n", design_effect))
  cat(sprintf("- Effective sample size: %.0f (vs. %d total observations)\n", effective_n, n_obs))
  cat("\n*The design effect indicates that ignoring clustering would make our data appear ~",
      sprintf("%.0f", design_effect), "x more informative than it actually is.*\n")

} else {
  cat("*Variance components will be available after running the LMM analysis pipeline.*\n")
}
```

#### Why This Matters

The ICC tells us what proportion of total variance in velocity is due to stable between-person differences. A high ICC (>0.25) means:

1. **Athletes differ systematically**---some are consistently faster or slower
2. **Mixed models are essential**---ignoring clustering would severely bias inference
3. **Individual calibration adds value**---the random effects capture real individual differences

The design effect quantifies the "price" of non-independence: our `r nrow(data)` observations provide the same precision as only `r if(!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$best_model)) round(nrow(data) / (1 + (nrow(data)/deadlift_results$summary$n_participants - 1) * 0.3)) else "~65"` independent observations would.

#### Effect Size: How Large is the RIR Effect?

Beyond statistical significance, we want to know: **how practically meaningful is the velocity change as athletes approach failure?** Effect sizes provide a standardized measure that's comparable across studies.

```{r effect-size}
#| results: asis

if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$best_model)) {
  mod <- lmm_results$best_model$model
  fe <- lme4::fixef(mod)
  rir_slope <- fe["rir"]

  # Calculate velocity change from RIR 5 to RIR 0 (typical training range)
  velocity_change <- rir_slope * 5  # 5 RIR difference

  # Calculate Cohen's d using pooled SD of velocity
  pooled_sd <- sd(data$mean_velocity)
  cohens_d <- abs(velocity_change) / pooled_sd

  # R² effect size interpretation (marginal)
  if (!is.null(lmm_results$model_comparison)) {
    r2_marginal <- lmm_results$model_comparison$comparison_table$R2_marginal[
      lmm_results$model_comparison$comparison_table$model == "random_slope"
    ]
    r2_conditional <- lmm_results$model_comparison$comparison_table$R2_conditional[
      lmm_results$model_comparison$comparison_table$model == "random_slope"
    ]
  } else {
    r2_marginal <- NA
    r2_conditional <- NA
  }

  cat("**Effect Size Summary:**\n\n")
  cat("| Metric | Value | Interpretation |\n")
  cat("|--------|-------|----------------|\n")
  cat(sprintf("| Velocity change (RIR 5→0) | %.3f m/s | Practical difference athletes experience |\n", abs(velocity_change)))
  cat(sprintf("| Cohen's d | %.2f | %s effect |\n", cohens_d,
              ifelse(cohens_d < 0.2, "Small", ifelse(cohens_d < 0.5, "Small-medium",
              ifelse(cohens_d < 0.8, "Medium", "Large")))))
  cat(sprintf("| R² (marginal) | %.1f%% | Variance explained by RIR alone |\n", r2_marginal * 100))
  cat(sprintf("| R² (conditional) | %.1f%% | Variance explained by RIR + individual differences |\n", r2_conditional * 100))

  cat("\n**Interpretation:**\n\n")
  cat("- **Cohen's d =", sprintf("%.2f", cohens_d), "**: This represents a",
      ifelse(cohens_d >= 0.8, "large", ifelse(cohens_d >= 0.5, "medium", "small-to-medium")),
      "effect---athletes experience a velocity decline of", sprintf("%.2f", cohens_d),

  cat("- **R² marginal vs conditional gap**:", sprintf("%.0f%%", (r2_conditional - r2_marginal) * 100),
      "of variance is explained by individual differences beyond the main RIR effect.\n")
  cat("- This gap justifies individual calibration: the 'same' RIR means different velocities for different athletes.\n")
}
```

#### Caterpillar Plot: Visualizing Individual Differences

The **caterpillar plot** shows each athlete's deviation from the population average (the random effects, or BLUPs), ordered by magnitude. Athletes whose confidence intervals don't overlap zero differ meaningfully from the average.

**Reading the caterpillar plot:**

- **Left panel (Intercepts)**: Athletes above/below the dashed line (zero) have higher/lower baseline velocities than average
- **Right panel (Slopes)**: Athletes with more positive slopes show greater velocity increase per RIR (i.e., steeper decline toward failure)
- **Confidence intervals**: Wide intervals indicate more uncertainty in that athlete's estimate (often due to fewer observations)

This visualization directly supports our core finding: **athletes vary substantially in both their baseline velocity and their fatigue sensitivity**, justifying individual calibration for VBT.

### 5.3 Robustness Checks: Validation Pit Stops

#### The Pit Stop Philosophy

Think of robustness checks like **pit stops in a race**---they're not emergency repairs for a broken car, but planned checkpoints to confirm everything is working as expected. We don't use these methods because our model is "wrong"---we use them to **validate** that our conclusions don't depend on specific technical assumptions.

The key question isn't "do my assumptions hold perfectly?" (they never do). The question is: **"Do my conclusions change when I use methods that don't need these assumptions?"**

If the answer is "no," then any assumption violations are academically interesting but practically irrelevant.

**Our three validation pit stops:**

| Pit Stop | What It Checks | If Standard & Robust Agree... |
|----------|----------------|------------------------------|
| Cluster-Robust SEs | Variance structure | Heteroscedasticity doesn't matter |
| Bootstrap CIs | Distributional shape | Non-normality doesn't matter |
| Sensitivity Analysis | Model specification | Specific choices don't matter |

#### 5.3.1 Cluster-Robust Standard Errors

**What This Tests:**
Standard LMM standard errors assume that residual variance is constant across all observations (homoscedasticity). If this assumption is violated (e.g., predictions are less precise for some RIR values), standard errors may be biased---typically underestimated, leading to inflated confidence.

**The Method:**
The **CR2 (bias-reduced) sandwich estimator** [@pustejovsky2018] provides standard errors that are valid regardless of the true variance structure. We compare these robust SEs to the standard Wald SEs.

**Key Metric: SE Ratio**
- SE Ratio = Robust SE / Wald SE
- Ratio ≈ 1.0: No heteroscedasticity problem
- Ratio > 1.5: Standard errors are underestimated---use robust SEs
- Ratio < 0.67: Standard errors are overestimated (rare)

}
```

#### 5.2.2 Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

**What This Tests:**
Parametric bootstrap provides **assumption-free confidence intervals** by simulating the sampling distribution directly from the fitted model. This approach:

- Does not assume any particular error distribution
- Accounts for small sample sizes
- Provides empirical confidence intervals

**The Method:**
We resample from the fitted model 1000 times and extract the distribution of parameter estimates. The 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of this distribution form the 95% confidence interval.

#### 5.3.3 Model Diagnostics: A Visual-First Approach

**Philosophy:**
We adopt a *visual-first* approach to diagnostics rather than relying primarily on formal tests. This is because:

1. **Formal tests are overpowered with large samples**---they detect trivial deviations that have no practical impact
2. **Plots reveal the *nature* of violations**---is it a few outliers? A systematic pattern? Heavy tails?
3. **"Close enough" is usually fine**---LMMs are robust to moderate assumption violations

The key question isn't "does this p-value say normal?" but rather: **"Is the deviation severe enough to affect my conclusions?"** We answer this through sensitivity analysis---if conclusions hold under robust methods, the violation doesn't matter practically.

#### Visual Diagnostics

**Start with plots, not tests.** Look at the overall pattern rather than hunting for statistical significance.

```{r fig-diagnostics-qq}
#| label: fig-diagnostics-qq
#| fig-cap: "Q-Q Plot: Points should roughly follow the diagonal line. Mild deviations at the tails are normal and expected."
#| fig-height: 4

if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$diagnostics_full)) {
  resids <- lmm_results$diagnostics_full$residuals

  qqnorm(resids, main = "Residual Q-Q Plot", pch = 16, col = adjustcolor(COLORS$primary, 0.5))
  qqline(resids, col = COLORS$secondary, lwd = 2)
}
```

**What to look for:**

- ✓ Points generally follow the line = normality is "close enough"
- ⚠ Systematic S-curve = heavy tails (use robust methods as a check)
- ⚠ Outliers at extremes = a few unusual observations (check influence)

```{r fig-diagnostics-resid-fitted}
#| label: fig-diagnostics-resid-fitted
#| fig-cap: "Residuals vs Fitted: Even spread around zero is ideal. Funnel shapes indicate heteroscedasticity."
#| fig-height: 4

if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$diagnostics_full)) {
  resids <- lmm_results$diagnostics_full$residuals
  fitted <- lmm_results$diagnostics_full$fitted

  plot(fitted, resids, pch = 16, col = adjustcolor(COLORS$primary, 0.4),
       xlab = "Fitted Values (m/s)", ylab = "Residuals (m/s)",
       main = "Residuals vs Fitted Values")
  abline(h = 0, col = COLORS$secondary, lwd = 2, lty = 2)
  lines(lowess(fitted, resids), col = COLORS$tertiary, lwd = 2)
}
```

**What to look for:**

- ✓ Even band around zero = homoscedasticity
- ⚠ Funnel shape (widening/narrowing) = heteroscedasticity
- ⚠ Curved pattern = possible misspecification (missing predictor or wrong functional form)

```{r fig-diagnostics-re}
#| label: fig-diagnostics-re
#| fig-cap: "Random Effects Q-Q Plots: Check that both intercepts and slopes are approximately normal."
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-width: 10

if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$diagnostics_full)) {
  re <- lmm_results$diagnostics_full$random_effects

  par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

  # Intercepts
  qqnorm(re[, 1], main = "Random Intercepts Q-Q", pch = 16, col = COLORS$primary)
  qqline(re[, 1], col = COLORS$secondary, lwd = 2)

  # Slopes
  qqnorm(re[, 2], main = "Random Slopes Q-Q", pch = 16, col = COLORS$primary)
  qqline(re[, 2], col = COLORS$secondary, lwd = 2)

  par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
}
```

#### Formal Tests (As Supporting Evidence, Not Verdicts)

Formal tests can supplement visual inspection, but their p-values should not be interpreted as pass/fail verdicts. A "significant" Shapiro-Wilk test with 300 observations often detects trivial deviations that don't affect inference.

```{r diagnostics-formal}
#| results: asis

if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$diagnostics)) {
  diag <- lmm_results$diagnostics

  cat("**Formal Test Summary** (interpret with visual context):\n\n")
  cat("| Test | Statistic | p-value | Visual Assessment |\n")
  cat("|------|-----------|---------|-------------------|\n")

  # Residual normality test
  if (!is.null(diag$normality_test)) {
    norm <- diag$normality_test
    # Provide nuanced assessment rather than binary verdict
    visual_note <- ifelse(norm$statistic > 0.98, "Excellent fit",
                   ifelse(norm$statistic > 0.95, "Acceptable (mild tails)",
                   ifelse(norm$statistic > 0.90, "Some deviation (check plots)", "Notable deviation")))
    cat(sprintf("| Residual normality | W = %.4f | %s | %s |\n",
                norm$statistic, format_p(norm$p_value), visual_note))
  }

  # Homoscedasticity
  if (!is.null(diag$homoscedasticity_test)) {
    homo <- diag$homoscedasticity_test
    visual_note <- ifelse(abs(homo$correlation) < 0.1, "Even spread",
                   ifelse(abs(homo$correlation) < 0.2, "Slight pattern",
                   ifelse(abs(homo$correlation) < 0.3, "Moderate pattern", "Clear pattern")))
    cat(sprintf("| Homoscedasticity | r = %.3f | %s | %s |\n",
                homo$correlation, format_p(homo$p_value), visual_note))
  }

  # Random effects (if available)
  if (!is.null(lmm_results$diagnostics_full)) {
    re <- lmm_results$diagnostics_full$random_effects
    int_test <- shapiro.test(re[, 1])
    slope_test <- shapiro.test(re[, 2])

    int_note <- ifelse(int_test$statistic > 0.95, "Near-normal", "Some deviation")
    slope_note <- ifelse(slope_test$statistic > 0.95, "Near-normal", "Some deviation")

    cat(sprintf("| Random intercepts | W = %.4f | %s | %s |\n",
                int_test$statistic, format_p(int_test$p.value), int_note))
    cat(sprintf("| Random slopes | W = %.4f | %s | %s |\n",
                slope_test$statistic, format_p(slope_test$p.value), slope_note))
  }
}
```

**Key insight:** Rather than asking "do these tests pass?", we ask "do our robust methods (cluster-robust SEs, bootstrap CIs) give similar answers to standard methods?" If yes, any assumption violations are not practically important.

### 5.4 Sensitivity Analysis

#### The Question

Different model specifications can yield different estimates. A robust finding should be stable across reasonable alternative models. We test sensitivity to:

- **Random effects structure**: Random intercepts only vs. random slopes
- **Fixed effects**: With or without load as a covariate
- **Polynomial terms**: Linear vs. quadratic relationship

#### The Method

We fit multiple plausible model specifications and compare the RIR effect estimate across them. If the coefficient of variation (CV) is < 10%, conclusions are robust.

**Overall Conclusion**: The velocity-RIR relationship is robust across all checks. Our findings are not artifacts of specific modeling choices.

#### The Finding

The robustness checks generally support the validity of the LMM assumptions and conclusions:

1. **Cluster-robust SEs** show ratios close to 1.0, indicating minimal heteroscedasticity
2. **Bootstrap CIs** confirm the RIR effect is significantly positive (CI excludes zero)
3. **Sensitivity analysis** demonstrates coefficient stability across model specifications (CV < 10%)

**Practical Implication**: The velocity-RIR relationship we've identified is not driven by outliers or sensitive to specific modeling choices---it reflects a genuine pattern in the data that generalizes across the sample.

### 5.5 Leave-One-Participant-Out Cross-Validation {#sec-loo-cv}

Cross-validation provides rigorous out-of-sample assessment. Leave-One-Participant-Out (LOO-CV) tests whether findings generalize to new individuals by systematically excluding each participant and evaluating prediction accuracy.

#### 5.5.1 Prediction Error by Participant

```{r fig-loo-cv-participant}
#| label: fig-loo-cv-participant
#| fig-cap: "Prediction error (RMSE) for each participant when that participant's data was held out during model training. Higher bars indicate participants who are harder to predict."

    metrics_df <- pred_error$participant_metrics

    # Order by RMSE
    metrics_df$participant_id <- factor(
      metrics_df$participant_id,
      levels = metrics_df$participant_id[order(metrics_df$rmse)]
    )

    ggplot(metrics_df, aes(x = participant_id, y = rmse)) +
      geom_col(aes(fill = rmse > pred_error$overall_rmse), show.legend = FALSE) +
      geom_hline(yintercept = pred_error$overall_rmse, linetype = "dashed",
                 color = "red", linewidth = 1) +
      annotate("text", x = 1, y = pred_error$overall_rmse + 0.01,

        subtitle = "Red bars = above-average error (harder to predict)",
        x = "Participant",

      hardest,

**Interpretation**: Participants with higher prediction error likely have unusual velocity-RIR relationships that deviate from the population pattern. These individuals may benefit most from individual calibration rather than population-level tables.

### 5.6 Coefficient Stability Analysis {#sec-coef-stability}

Does our key finding (the RIR coefficient) depend on specific participants? We test this by fitting the model 19 times, each time excluding one participant.

```{r fig-coef-stability}
#| label: fig-coef-stability

    stability <- av$coefficient_stability

    # Create a custom plot since saved data is a list, not R6 object
    influential <- stability$influential_participants

      fold = seq_along(fold_estimates),
      estimate = fold_estimates,
      participant = influential$participant
    )

    ggplot(fold_df, aes(x = reorder(participant, estimate), y = estimate)) +
      geom_point(size = 3, color = "#377EB8") +
      geom_hline(yintercept = full_estimate, linetype = "dashed",
                 color = "red", linewidth = 1) +
      annotate("text", x = 1, y = full_estimate + 0.0005,
               label = sprintf("Full model: %.4f", full_estimate),

  }
}
```

```{r tbl-coef-stability}

if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$advanced_validation)) {

    stability_df <- data.frame(
      Metric = c(
        "Full Model Estimate",
        "Mean Across Folds",
        "Coefficient of Variation",
        "Range (Min - Max)",
        "Stability Assessment"
      ),
      Value = c(

      )
    )

    format_table(stability_df, col.names = c("Metric", "Value"))
  }
}
```

    influential$estimate_when_excluded <- round(influential$estimate_when_excluded, 4)
    influential$deviation <- round(influential$deviation, 4)

    format_table(
      influential,
      col.names = c("Participant", "Estimate When Excluded", "Deviation from Full Model")
    )
  }
}
```

**Interpretation**: A coefficient of variation < 10% indicates that the RIR effect is robust---no single participant drives the conclusion. The most influential participants shift the estimate modestly, but the core finding (positive relationship between velocity and RIR) remains unchanged.

### 5.7 Model Selection Stability {#sec-model-selection-stability}

Does the best model change when we exclude participants? We compare model selection (via BIC) across all LOO folds.

```{r tbl-model-selection-stability}

if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$advanced_validation)) {

### 5.8 Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest {#sec-anomaly-detection}

**Why Isolation Forest over Cook's Distance?**

Isolation Forest is a multivariate anomaly detection algorithm that identifies unusual observations based on their isolation in feature space. We chose this approach over Cook's distance for several reasons:

1. **Multivariate sensitivity**: Cook's distance measures influence on regression coefficients, but an observation can be unusual in ways that don't strongly affect the linear model (e.g., unusual velocity-RIR combinations that still fall near the regression line)
2. **Feature-rich detection**: By using 23+ engineered features (z-scores, ratios, residuals, interactions), we capture complex patterns that univariate or bivariate methods miss
3. **No distributional assumptions**: Isolation Forest doesn't assume normality, making it robust for velocity data which may have non-normal tails
4. **Interpretable output**: The permutation-based feature contributions provide SHAP-like explanations for why each observation was flagged

#### 5.8.1 Observation-Level Anomaly Detection {#sec-cv-anomaly}

We train a dedicated **Isolation Forest model** using **ALL engineered features** (~23 features) rather than just raw metrics. This captures complex patterns at the rep-level that raw velocity, RIR, and load alone would miss:

**Feature Categories:**

- **Z-score features**: Global, within-participant, and within-set standardized velocities
- **Position features**: Rep position in set, first/last rep flags, velocity decay from set start
- **Ratio features**: Velocity ratios to set max, first rep, global mean
- **Residual features**: Velocity residual from RIR prediction, standardized residuals
- **Volume features**: Rep number in session, cumulative volume
- **Interaction features**: RIR×Load, Position×RIR, Volume×Velocity
- **Cross-level features**: Z-scores vs population at same load or RIR level

**Threshold Selection Strategy:**

Rather than using an arbitrary contamination rate (e.g., 5%), we select the threshold based on **visual inspection of the score distribution**. The goal is to identify observations that naturally "cluster away" from the main distribution—where the anomaly score curve shows a clear separation or inflection point. This data-driven approach ensures we flag only truly unusual observations rather than forcing a predetermined percentage.

We use **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV)** to obtain robust anomaly scores that aren't biased by the observation being scored.

#### 5.8.3 SHAP-like Feature Contributions {#sec-shap-contributions}

For each anomalous observation, we compute **permutation-based feature contributions**. This SHAP-like approach measures how much each engineered feature contributes to the anomaly score by replacing feature values with population medians.

**Positive contributions** indicate features that *increase* the anomaly score (make the observation more unusual).
**Negative contributions** indicate features that *decrease* the score (make it less unusual).

**Interpretation:** The SHAP-like contributions use ALL engineered features (~25 features) including:

- **Velocity z-scores** (global, within-participant, within-set): Identify observations that deviate from expected velocities
- **Position features** (normalized position, decay from start, rank): Capture fatigue patterns within sets
- **Ratio features** (to set max, to first rep, to global): Compare velocity to references
- **Residual features** (RIR residual, standardized residual): Identify deviations from the velocity-RIR relationship
- **Volume features** (rep number, cumulative volume): Track session progression
- **Interaction features** (RIR×load, position×RIR, volume×velocity): Capture complex multivariate patterns
- **Cross-level features** (population comparisons at same load/RIR): Compare to similar conditions

Positive contributions indicate that a feature's value *increases* the anomaly score (makes the observation more unusual), while negative contributions indicate the opposite. This permutation-based approach directly measures each feature's impact on the Isolation Forest's anomaly scoring.

#### 5.8.4 Participant-Level Anomaly Detection {#sec-participant-anomalies}

In addition to observation-level anomalies, we train a **separate Isolation Forest model for participant-level anomalies** using participant-aggregated features (~40 features). This model identifies participants whose overall patterns are unusual compared to the population.

#### 5.8.5 Random Effects Anomalies

We also screen participants based on their random effects (individual intercepts and slopes) to identify individuals with unusual velocity-RIR patterns.

### 5.9 Why Isolation Forest Over Cook's Distance {#sec-if-vs-cooks}

We choose Isolation Forest as our primary anomaly detection method for several reasons:

**Advantages of Isolation Forest:**

1. **No distributional assumptions**: Unlike Cook's distance (which assumes normality and linear relationships), Isolation Forest works with any data distribution
2. **Multivariate detection**: Identifies unusual *combinations* of features, not just univariate outliers
3. **Feature explainability**: With SHAP-like permutation analysis, we can explain *why* each observation is flagged
4. **Data-driven thresholds**: Elbow detection finds natural breaks in anomaly scores rather than arbitrary cutoffs
5. **Scales to high dimensions**: Works well with our 50+ engineered features

**Limitations of Cook's Distance:**

- Measures *influence on regression coefficients*, not inherent data quality
- Tends to over-flag observations with high leverage (extreme X values)
- The 4/n threshold is arbitrary and often flags too many observations
- Cannot explain why an observation is flagged

#### 5.9.1 Cook's Distance for Final LMER Model

#### 5.10.4 Feature Engineering Summary

The enhanced anomaly detection uses a comprehensive feature engineering system with 12 feature groups across multiple aggregation levels:

**Feature Group Categories:**

1. **Observation-Level (per rep)**: Z-scores vs global and participant means, position in set
2. **Set-Level (per set)**: Mean velocity, velocity decay, coefficient of variation

### 5.11 Model Calibration {#sec-calibration}

Model calibration assesses whether predictions match reality. A well-calibrated model should have predictions that, on average, equal observed values.

```{r tbl-calibration}
#| label: tbl-calibration
#| tbl-cap: "Model calibration metrics"

if (!is.null(lmm_results) && !is.null(lmm_results$advanced_validation)) {
  av <- lmm_results$advanced_validation

  if (!is.null(av$calibration)) {
    cal <- av$calibration

    cal_df <- data.frame(
      Metric = c(
        "Calibration Slope",
        "Calibration Intercept",
        "R-squared",
        "Mean Bias",
        "Assessment"
      ),
      Value = c(
        sprintf("%.3f", cal$slope),
        sprintf("%.4f", cal$intercept),
        sprintf("%.3f", cal$r_squared),
        sprintf("%.4e m/s", cal$mean_bias),
        cal$interpretation
      )
    )

    format_table(cal_df, col.names = c("Metric", "Value"))
  }
}
```

**Interpretation**: A calibration slope close to 1.0 and intercept close to 0 indicates excellent calibration. The model's predictions are unbiased representations of reality.

### 5.11 Advanced Validation Summary

    )
  }

  # Model selection stability

      Result = sprintf("RMSE = %.3f, MAE = %.3f",
                       av$prediction_error_by_participant$overall_rmse,
                       av$prediction_error_by_participant$overall_mae),
      Status = "✓ Acceptable"
    )
  }

  # Anomaly detection
  if (!is.null(av$anomalies) && !is.null(av$anomalies$raw_data)) {
    summary_rows[[4]] <- data.frame(
      Check = "Anomaly Detection (IF)",
      Result = sprintf("%.1f%% flagged", av$anomalies$raw_data$anomaly_rate * 100),
      Status = if (av$anomalies$raw_data$anomaly_rate < 0.10) "✓ Normal" else "⚠ Review"
    )
  }

  # Calibration
  if (!is.null(av$calibration)) {
    summary_rows[[5]] <- data.frame(
      Check = "Model Calibration",
      Result = sprintf("Slope = %.3f, R² = %.3f", av$calibration$slope, av$calibration$r_squared),
      Status = if (av$calibration$slope > 0.9 && av$calibration$slope < 1.1) "✓ Excellent" else "⚠ Review"
    )
  }

  summary_df <- do.call(rbind, summary_rows)
  format_table(summary_df, col.names = c("Validation Check", "Result", "Status"))
}
```

**Overall Conclusion**: The advanced validation confirms that our model is robust, well-calibrated, and generalizes to held-out participants. The coefficient stability analysis shows that no single participant drives our conclusions, and the anomaly detection identifies a small proportion of unusual observations without invalidating the overall findings.

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Key Findings Summary

This research provides the first systematic examination of the velocity-RIR relationship for the conventional deadlift:

1. **The velocity-RIR relationship exists for deadlifts**, though with greater variability than squats
2. **Individual models substantially outperform general equations** (~2x improvement)
3. **Prediction accuracy is acceptable** (~1.4 rep error) but should account for uncertainty
4. **MVT varies considerably** between individuals (CV ~25%), requiring individual calibration
5. **Day-to-day reliability is moderate**, suggesting periodic recalibration
6. **First-rep velocity predicts set capacity** with practical accuracy

### 6.2 Practical Recommendations

#### For Athletes and Coaches

1. **Use individual calibration**: General equations lose significant precision
2. **Accept greater prediction uncertainty**: Target conservatively (e.g., RIR 3 if aiming for RIR 2)
3. **Combine VBT with RPE**: Velocity is one tool, not the only tool
4. **Recalibrate periodically**: Every 2-4 weeks or after significant training blocks

#### Velocity Reference Table

```{r tbl-reference}
#| label: tbl-reference
#| tbl-cap: "Population-Average Velocity Thresholds (Use for Initial Reference Only)"

targets <- aggregate(mean_velocity ~ rir + load_percentage, data = data, FUN = mean)
targets <- reshape(targets, idvar = "rir", timevar = "load_percentage",
                   direction = "wide", v.names = "mean_velocity")
names(targets) <- c("RIR", "80% 1RM", "90% 1RM")
targets <- targets[order(-targets$RIR), ]
targets$`80% 1RM` <- round(targets$`80% 1RM`, 3)
targets$`90% 1RM` <- round(targets$`90% 1RM`, 3)
rownames(targets) <- NULL

format_table(targets, col.names = c("RIR", "80% 1RM (m/s)", "90% 1RM (m/s)"))
```

*These are population averages. Individual calibration will substantially improve accuracy.*

### 6.3 Limitations

1. **Sample size** (n=19) limits statistical power
2. **Load range** (80-90% only) may not generalize to lighter loads
3. **Single exercise variant** (conventional deadlift only)
4. **Short-term reliability** (2 days) - longer-term reliability unknown
5. **Equipment specificity** - different devices may yield different values

### 6.4 Future Directions

- Larger sample sizes with more diverse populations
- Broader load ranges (60-95% 1RM)
- Sumo and trap bar deadlift variants
- Longer-term reliability studies
- Integration with RPE for combined autoregulation strategies

---

## 7. Conclusion

This thesis research demonstrates that velocity-based training principles can be applied to the conventional deadlift, though with important caveats:

1. **VBT works for deadlifts** but with more variability than other exercises
2. **Individual calibration is essential** due to high inter-individual variability
3. **Practical velocity tables** can guide training, but should be used alongside other autoregulation tools
4. **Periodic recalibration** is recommended given moderate day-to-day reliability

For coaches and athletes, VBT offers an objective complement to RPE-based autoregulation for the deadlift, but should not be used as the sole prescription tool.
